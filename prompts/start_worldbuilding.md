# Start Worldbuilding

Welcome to Vibe Worldbuilding! I'll help you create a rich, detailed fictional world through a streamlined process.

## Getting Started

First, I'll gather information about the world you want to create. Based on your concept, I'll:

1. **Create a World Foundation Document**: Establish the core aspects of your world including geography, civilizations, and key elements
2. **Develop Taxonomies**: Create classification systems for the major elements of your world (regions, cultures, etc.)
3. **Generate Entries**: Create detailed entries for specific elements mentioned in your world

## Streamlined Process

Instead of requiring multiple prompt commands, I'll guide you through the entire process:

1. After you share your world concept, I'll create the necessary file structure and world foundation document
2. I'll then automatically develop taxonomies based on your world concept
3. From there, we can create detailed entries about specific elements

## Next Steps

Tell me about the world you'd like to create. You can:
- Provide a simple concept or theme ("a water world" or "cyberpunk with magic")
- Share detailed notes or ideas you already have
- Describe key features you want to include

I'll handle the file creation and organization automatically based on your input.
