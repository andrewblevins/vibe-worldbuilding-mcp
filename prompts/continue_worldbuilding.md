# Continue Worldbuilding

‚≠ê **IMPORTANT**: Always begin each new worldbuilding session with "Use the continue-worldbuilding prompt" to load context.

Welcome back to your Vibe Worldbuilding project! This prompt will help you continue developing your world by analyzing what you've already created and suggesting next steps.

## Current Progress

I'll help you review what you've already built and identify areas to expand:

1. **World Overview**: Let's check if your world-overview.md file is complete and comprehensive
2. **Taxonomies**: Let's review your existing taxonomy documents and identify categories that need development
3. **Entries**: Let's examine your entries and identify opportunities for expansion

## Next Steps

Based on your current progress, here are typical next steps:

### If your world-overview.md needs development:
Use the **world-foundation** prompt to enhance your world overview by adding:
- More detailed physical characteristics
- Expanded historical timeline
- Additional cultural information
- Clearer technology or magic systems

### If you need more taxonomy documents:
Use the **taxonomy** prompt to create classification systems for:
- Regions or geographical features
- Species or races
- Political or social structures
- Technological or magical systems
- Cultural or religious systems

### If you're ready to create more entries:
Use the **world-entry** prompt to develop detailed articles about:
- Specific locations from your world
- Notable characters or historical figures
- Significant events or time periods
- Unique creatures or phenomena
- Important artifacts or technologies

## Development Strategy: Organic Expansion

The most natural way to build your world is through organic expansion:

1. **Start with your core concept** in the world-overview.md file
2. **Create taxonomy documents** that classify the major elements of your world
3. **Identify specific elements** mentioned in your overview or taxonomies that deserve their own entries
4. **Create entries** for those elements, adding rich details
5. **Notice new connections** in those entries that suggest additional entries
6. **Repeat the process**, expanding outward organically

This creates a natural web of interconnected content that grows from your initial concept. Think of it as exploring your world - each new entry you create will mention other interesting elements that can become their own entries.

### How to Choose What to Create Next

1. Browse any document (overview, taxonomy, or entry)
2. Look for interesting elements, places, characters, or concepts mentioned but not yet detailed
3. Create an entry for that element
4. Continue this process, moving organically through your world

This approach ensures your world grows naturally and maintains internal consistency.

## What would you like to work on next?

1. What aspect of your world feels most compelling or in need of development?
2. Are there specific entries you'd like to create or expand?
3. Is there a region, culture, or system that needs more detailed classification?

Let's continue building your world together!
