# Meridian City

## Description
Meridian is the largest metropolitan center in the [[Western Provinces]], known for its distinctive skyline of emotion-reactive architecture. The city sprawls along both banks of the [[Cerulean River]], with its famous Chromabridge connecting the ancient eastern district with the newer western developments.

## Geography and Location
Situated at the confluence of the [[Cerulean River]] and the [[Sapphire Sea]], Meridian enjoys a strategic position that has made it a natural trading hub. The city is surrounded by the rolling [[Viridian Hills]] to the north and fertile plains to the south.

## History
Founded in 842 by [[Emperor Talus III]] as a military outpost, Meridian grew rapidly during the [[Age of Emotional Awakening]] when its natural concentration of joy-chromaether attracted numerous talented Chromaweavers. After the [[Great Resonance Disaster]] of 1023, the city was largely rebuilt, giving it its current architectural character.

## Culture and Society
Meridian's society is structured around the eight recognized Emotional Guilds, with the [[Joy Harmonics]] and [[Serenity Shapers]] holding the most political influence. The city is renowned for its Chromatic Arts Festival held during the spring equinox, which attracts artists who work with emotion-infused materials from across [[Aetheria]].

## Significance
As the seat of the [[Western Emotional Council]] and home to the prestigious [[Chromatic Academy]], Meridian serves as both a political and educational center. It's also the largest trading port for emotion-infused artifacts and chromaether crystals.

## Connections
- [[Chromatic Academy]]
- [[Western Emotional Council]]
- [[Joy Harmonics Guild]]

## Notes
Revision focused on adding geographical context, historical background, and stronger connections to the emotional magic system. Added specific cross-references to other locations and institutions that should be developed as separate entries.
