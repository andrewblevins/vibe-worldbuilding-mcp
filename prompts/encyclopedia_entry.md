# World Entry

This prompt will help you create detailed entries for specific elements of your fictional world. Each entry should be a comprehensive article about a single person, place, creature, technology, event, or concept.

## Purpose
Entries form the detailed layer of your world, expanding on elements mentioned in your world overview and organized according to your taxonomy documents. Each entry is a standalone file in the Entries/ directory.

## Entry Structure

All entries should begin with a title and overview section:

```markdown

After that, the structure varies by entry type, but commonly includes these sections:

## Cross-Referencing
When mentioning something that has its own entry, consider creating a cross-reference by mentioning the entry explicitly, which can help you track connections between entries.

## Best Practices

- Begin with a strong overview that captures the essence of the entry
- Include vivid descriptions that help readers imagine the subject
- Connect each entry to the broader world and other entries
- Balance detail with readability - aim for comprehensive but concise
- Consider including conflicts, contradictions, or mysteries to add depth
- Ensure consistency with your world overview and taxonomy documents

Your entries should bring specific elements of your world to life in rich detail.
