# Taxonomy Document

This prompt will help you create a taxonomy document for your fictional world. Taxonomies provide classification systems for major categories in your world, organizing the information into logical structures and relationships.

## Purpose
Taxonomy documents serve as the middle layer between your world overview and specific entries. They establish how elements in a particular category are organized, related, and distinguished from each other.

## Taxonomy Document Structure

Your taxonomy document in the Taxonomies/ directory should follow this structure:

### 1. Title and Overview
```markdown
# Taxonomy: [Category Name]

## Classification System
[Explain the fundamental principles used to classify elements in this category]
```

### 2. Primary Categories
```markdown
## Primary Categories

### By [Classification Criterion]
1. **[Category 1]** - [Brief description]
2. **[Category 2]** - [Brief description]
3. **[Category 3]** - [Brief description]

### By [Alternative Classification Criterion]
1. **[Alternative Category 1]** - [Brief description]
...
```

### 3. Notable Examples
```markdown
## Notable [Category] Types

### [Example 1]
[Brief description of a significant example within this taxonomy]

### [Example 2]
[Brief description of another significant example]
...
```

### 4. Relationships
```markdown
## Relationships Between [Category] Types
[Explain how different elements in this taxonomy relate to and interact with each other]
```

## Common Taxonomy Categories

Some common taxonomy documents you might create include:
- **regions.md** - Geographic divisions, climate zones, terrain types
- **species.md** - Intelligent races and significant creatures
- **settlements.md** - Types of communities and habitations
- **technologies.md** - Technological developments and systems
- **cultural-groups.md** - Social organizations and cultural divisions
- **magic-systems.md** - Types of magical practices (if applicable)
- **religions.md** - Belief systems and practices
- **political-systems.md** - Forms of governance and power structures

## Best Practices

- Focus on organizational principles rather than exhaustive listings
- Provide clear distinguishing characteristics between categories
- Include multiple classification systems where appropriate (e.g., by location, by function)
- Keep descriptions brief but informative
- Consider how your taxonomy connects to other aspects of your world
- Include enough detail to guide the creation of specific entries within each category

Taxonomies should make your world feel organized and logical while allowing for rich diversity within each category.
