# Vibe Worldbuilding Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for building your fictional world.

## ‚≠ê Important Usage Pattern

**Always begin each new worldbuilding session with:**
```
Use the continue-worldbuilding prompt
```
This loads the worldbuilding context and guides your next steps.

## Step 1: Start Worldbuilding

Begin with the `start-worldbuilding` prompt or the `start_worldbuilding` tool. This will:
- Set up the necessary directory structure (`Taxonomies/` and `Entries/` directories)
- Create a placeholder for your world-overview.md file
- Generate example files to demonstrate the structure

## Step 2: Continue Worldbuilding

When you return to your project, use the `continue-worldbuilding` prompt to:
- Assess your current progress
- Identify which areas need development
- Get suggestions for what to work on next

## Step 3: Develop World Overview

Use the `world-foundation` prompt to create your comprehensive world-overview.md file (accessible via the `world-overview://overview` resource):
- Define the central concept of your world
- Establish physical characteristics and major features
- Outline intelligent life forms
- Describe technology or magic systems
- Sketch a historical timeline

This document serves as the foundation for all other content.

## Step 4: Create Taxonomy Documents

Use the `taxonomy` prompt to define classification systems in your `Taxonomies/` directory:
- regions.md - Geographic divisions, climate zones, terrain types
- species.md - Intelligent races and significant creatures
- settlements.md - Types of communities and habitations
- technologies.md - Technological developments and systems
- cultural-groups.md - Social organizations and cultural divisions

Each taxonomy document establishes how a category of elements in your world is organized and related.

## Step 5: Generate World Entries

Use the `encyclopedia-entry` prompt to create individual entries in your `Entries/` directory:
- Cities, regions, and landmarks
- Notable characters and historical figures
- Creatures and species
- Technological innovations and artifacts
- Cultural practices and concepts
- Significant historical events

Each entry is a standalone markdown file with detailed information about a specific element.

## Step 6: Review for Consistency

Use the `consistency-review` prompt to analyze entries for logical consistency:
- Check for timeline contradictions
- Verify technological consistency
- Ensure cultural practices align with established principles

## Step 7: Revise and Expand

Use the `entry-revision` prompt to improve existing entries:
- Add cross-references between related entries
- Expand underdeveloped sections
- Refine content for clarity and consistency

## Step 8: Track Progress

Use the `list_entries` tool to monitor your world's growth:
- View all entries and taxonomies
- Search for entries by keyword

## Recommended Approach: Organic Expansion

Build your world through natural, organic growth:

1. **Start with a core concept** - Begin with your central idea
2. **Develop the foundation** - Create your world overview and basic taxonomies
3. **Identify key elements** - Note specific things mentioned that deserve entries
4. **Create entries** - Develop individual entries for those elements
5. **Discover new connections** - Each entry will mention new elements
6. **Expand outward** - Create entries for those newly mentioned elements

This creates a natural web of interconnected content, growing outward from your initial concept like branches from a tree trunk. Rather than planning everything in advance, let your world evolve organically through the creation process.

**To choose what to create next:**
- Review any document (overview, taxonomy, or existing entry)
- Look for interesting elements mentioned but not yet detailed 
- Create an entry for that element
- Continue this process, moving naturally through your world
