# Stellaris Operatica

In the year 2847, the galaxy revolves around **The Grand Harmonic**, a vast network of orbital opera houses that serve as both cultural centers and governing bodies. Each star system is ruled by an **Opera Lord** - master singers whose vocal performances literally manipulate gravity, space-time, and stellar energy.

## The Core Concept

Music is physics. The universe resonates with harmonic frequencies that trained vocalists can tap into through operatic performance. A perfectly executed aria can:
- Bend spacetime for faster-than-light travel
- Terraform planets through sonic landscaping
- Generate defensive force fields
- Control stellar fusion rates

## The Great Houses

Three major Opera Houses compete for galactic dominance:

- **House Crescendo** - Masters of epic space battles, their war songs can detonate stars
- **House Diminuendo** - Specialists in stealth and espionage, their whispered arias bend light itself
- **House Fortissimo** - Builders and terraformers, their choruses reshape entire worlds

## Current Crisis

The legendary **Phantom Conductor** has stolen the **Cosmic Score** - the fundamental musical notation that keeps the galaxy's physics stable. Without it, stars are going silent, gravity is failing, and the very fabric of space begins to unravel.

Only a young apprentice singer with a mysterious past holds the key to stopping the universe from falling into eternal, deadly silence.
