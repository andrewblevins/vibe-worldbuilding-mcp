# Resonance Storms

## Physical Description
Resonance Storms appear as swirling galaxies of multicolored light spanning 10-50 astronomical units, with lightning-like tendrils of pure harmonic energy crackling between floating islands of crystallized sound. The storms pulse with visible musical notation that scrolls across their surface in languages both ancient and unknown. Temperature readings vary wildly from absolute zero to stellar core heat within the same storm system.

## Harmonic Properties
Each storm resonates at a unique fundamental frequency, typically in the infrasonic range below 20 Hz, with complex overtones that extend into cosmic radio frequencies. The storms actively "listen" to nearby vocal performances and will amplify, harmonize with, or violently counter-sing against approaching voices. Master singers can tune their performances to match a storm's frequency, riding the harmonic currents like cosmic wind.

## Formation/Origin
Resonance Storms birth spontaneously when multiple Opera Houses perform competing techniques in the same sector simultaneously. The conflicting musical energies create standing wave patterns in space-time that eventually collapse into these semi-permanent phenomena. Some ancient storms are believed to be the dying echoes of the legendary Harmonic Empire's final performance before their mysterious disappearance.

## Effects on Reality
Within a Resonance Storm, the normal laws of physics become suggestions rather than rules. Gravity flows in musical patterns, matter can exist in multiple harmonious states simultaneously, and time moves at tempos that match the storm's rhythm. Ships caught in storms report crew members aging backwards, forward, or not at all depending on which part of the storm they occupy.

## Interaction Protocols
Approach requires a Singer-Navigator performing the Navigational Diminuendo while the ship's hull resonates at precisely the storm's inverse frequency. Entry without proper harmonic preparation results in immediate crystallization of all organic matter aboard the vessel. Emergency escape involves the crew performing a synchronized silence - the most difficult vocal technique of all.

## Navigation/Travel
Experienced storm-riders use Resonance Storms for instantaneous travel across vast distances. By matching the storm's frequency perfectly, ships can "surf" the harmonic currents and emerge from corresponding storms elsewhere in the galaxy, sometimes arriving before they left.
