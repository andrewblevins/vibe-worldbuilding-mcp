# The Grand Harmonic Amphitheater

## Overview
The Grand Harmonic Amphitheater is the most prestigious performance venue in the galaxy, serving as the ceremonial heart of the operatic empire. This massive space station orbits the galactic core, where stellar radiation provides the perfect harmonic resonance for the most powerful vocal performances.

## Architecture
Built from crystallized starlight and resonant metals, the amphitheater can accommodate over 100,000 spectators across multiple dimensional planes. The central stage hovers in zero gravity, allowing performers to literally dance among the stars as they sing.

## Significance
Here, the greatest Opera Lords demonstrate their mastery over cosmic forces. [Professor Viola Starforge](/taxonomies/characters/entries/professor-viola-starforge) conducts her most important research here, studying how the venue's unique properties amplify vocal techniques.

## Current Events
Recent disturbances in the amphitheater's harmonic field suggest the theft of the Cosmic Score is affecting even this most sacred space. Without the fundamental musical notation, performances are becoming increasingly unstable.
