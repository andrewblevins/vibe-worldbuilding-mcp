# Artifacts - Taxonomy Overview

## Description

## Entry Structure for Artifacts
Each artifacts entry should include:

### Required Sections
- **Physical Description**: Detailed appearance, materials, dimensions, and any visible inscriptions or markings
- **Harmonic Properties**: Musical capabilities, resonance frequencies, and how the artifact responds to or amplifies vocal techniques
- **Historical Context**: Origins, age, connection to ancient civilizations, and how it was discovered
- **Powers & Abilities**: Specific magical or technological functions, limitations, and effects on reality
- **Current Status**: Location, ownership, security measures, and accessibility

### Optional Sections (choose 2-3 most relevant)
- **Discovery Account**: The story of how the artifact was found and by whom
- **Research Findings**: Scientific analysis, translation attempts, or experimental results
- **Cultural Impact**: How the artifact has influenced modern Opera Houses or galactic politics

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: 300-450 words to maintain focus while providing rich detail about mysterious objects
- **Complexity Control**: Reference 1-2 major historical events or figures but avoid overwhelming backstory
- **Focus**: Emphasize the artifact's connection to lost musical knowledge and ancient power
- **Relationships**: Connect to specific characters who discovered or studied the artifact, or locations where it was found

## Tone and Style
Write with archaeological wonder mixed with operatic mystique. Blend scholarly analysis with hints of ancient magic and lost knowledge. Maintain an sense of reverence for these remnants of greater civilizations while highlighting their continued relevance to the modern musical galaxy.
