# Cosmic Phenomena - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Cosmic phenomena, stellar objects, and space-time anomalies affected by or related to operatic performances

## Entry Structure for Cosmic Phenomena
Each cosmic phenomena entry should include:

### Required Sections
- **Physical Description**: Observable characteristics, scale, appearance, and scientific measurements of the phenomenon
- **Harmonic Properties**: Musical frequencies, resonance patterns, and how the phenomenon responds to operatic performances
- **Formation/Origin**: How the phenomenon came to exist, whether naturally or through vocal manipulation
- **Effects on Reality**: How the phenomenon influences local space-time, gravity, matter, or other cosmic forces
- **Interaction Protocols**: Safe approaches for singers, required vocal techniques, and precautions needed

### Optional Sections (choose 2-3 most relevant)
- **Historical Significance**: Major events or discoveries connected to this phenomenon
- **Navigation/Travel**: How space travel is affected by or utilizes this phenomenon
- **Research Status**: Current scientific understanding and ongoing studies

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: 350-500 words to balance scientific detail with operatic mysticism
- **Complexity Control**: Reference 1-2 vocal techniques or Opera Houses but focus primarily on the phenomenon itself
- **Focus**: Emphasize the intersection of cosmic science and musical magic
- **Relationships**: Connect to specific locations, vocal techniques, or historical events when relevant

## Tone and Style
Write with scientific wonder tinged with operatic grandeur. Blend astrophysics terminology with musical concepts. Maintain an sense of cosmic scale and mystery while explaining how music shapes the very fabric of space and time.
