# Philosophical Movements - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Splinter groups and philosophical schools that emerged in response to the Immutable Stone, challenging both cultures' fundamental beliefs

## Entry Guidelines for Philosophical Movements
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Core Revelation** - The specific aspect of the Immutable Stone that sparked this movement. What impossible truth did they glimpse that others missed?
- **Philosophical Response** - Their interpretation and theoretical framework. How do they reconcile the Stone with their culture's worldview, or reject it entirely?
- **Practices & Rituals** - Concrete ways adherents express their beliefs - meditation techniques, gatherings, experiments, or protests. Show don't just tell.
- **Cultural Position** - Are they tolerated eccentrics, dangerous heretics, or something between? Include reactions from orthodox members and authorities.

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Founding Vision** - A dramatic account of the movement's origin - perhaps a philosopher's breakdown or mystic experience at the Stone
- **Internal Schisms** - Disagreements within the movement that reveal deeper philosophical tensions
- **Sacred Texts or Teachings** - Excerpts from manifestos, koans, temporal paradoxes, or impossible instructions
- **Notable Incidents** - Confrontations, experiments gone wrong, or public demonstrations that defined the movement

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Capture the intellectual vertigo of confronting the impossible - these aren't dry academic movements
- Use contradictions and paradoxes, especially for movements bridging both cultures
- Include voices of adherents, critics, and confused observers
- Show how the Stone forces each group into uncomfortable philosophical positions
- Let the Portland vibes shine through - even heretical philosophy has a coffee shop aesthetic

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
