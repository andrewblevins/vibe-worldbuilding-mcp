# Major Events - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Catastrophes, conflicts, purges, and disasters that have shaped both cultures - where philosophy turns violent and reality itself breaks down

## Entry Guidelines for Major Events
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **The Breaking Point** - What triggered the catastrophe—philosophical disagreements that turned violent, reality-warping experiments gone wrong, or the moment polite avoidance failed
- **The Horror Itself** - Visceral details of what actually happened—bodies, destruction, temporal fractures, mass madness. Don't sanitize the consequences of philosophical extremism
- **Death Toll & Damage** - Concrete numbers where possible, or descriptions of loss when temporal distortions make counting impossible. Include psychological and existential casualties
- **Lasting Scars** - How the event permanently changed both cultures—new taboos, trauma responses, architectural adaptations, or reality itself bearing wounds

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Survivor Accounts** - First-hand testimonies that capture the human cost, especially from those caught between worldviews
- **The Cover-Up** - Official attempts to minimize, deny, or reframe the event to preserve ideological purity
- **Ongoing Consequences** - If the event hasn't truly ended—temporal echoes, generational trauma, or reality still bleeding
- **Monuments & Memorials** - How (or if) the cultures remember their atrocities—or deliberately forget

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Don't shy away from the genuine darkness of ideological violence and reality breakdown
- Show how philosophical purity becomes zealotry becomes atrocity
- Include the voices of victims, not just perpetrators and theorists
- Capture the specific horror of temporal/entropic weapons and their impossible wounds
- Let the Portland setting make the horror more uncanny—artisanal torture devices, locally-sourced suffering

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
