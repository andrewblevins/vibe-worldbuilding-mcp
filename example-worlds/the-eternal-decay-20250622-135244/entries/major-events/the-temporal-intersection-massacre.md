# The Temporal Intersection Massacre

## The Breaking Point

It began as an accident at the Burnside Temporal Market, where Moment-Dwellers and Timeys had grudgingly traded for decades. A Sequential Heretic, deep in Stone-induced temporal psychosis, experienced what witnesses called a "time seizure"—violently shifting between linear and non-linear perception. In their thrashing, they knocked over a Permanence Weaver's stall of "entropy-locked" artifacts.

The items shattered, releasing what the Weavers had trapped: accelerated decay fields that aged anything they touched by centuries in seconds. A Moment-Dweller child, reaching for pretty mushrooms, crumbled to dust. Their parent's scream existed in all moments simultaneously.

## The Horror Itself

What followed defied both cultures' understanding of causality. The Moment-Dweller's grief became weaponized—they grabbed the nearest Timey and forced them to experience the child's death in every possible moment, past and future, until the Timey's mind shattered like glass. The Permanence Weavers released more decay fields to "defend themselves." The Sequential Heretics, caught between temporal states, became living paradoxes—aging and reversing, dying and being born, existing in multiple states of decomposition simultaneously.

The Stone Deniers arrived to "not see" the violence, but their aggressive ignorance created perception voids—spaces where victims simply ceased to be acknowledged, trapped between existence and non-existence, screaming unheard. Entropy Orthodox priests tried to "bless" the chaos, accelerating the decay until the market became a temporal wound, a place where cause and effect tangled into a gore-slicked knot.

Bodies piled in impossible ways: skeletons that hadn't finished dying, children aged into dust while their screams remained young, merchants frozen mid-transaction as their flesh rotted off their still-moving bones.

## Death Toll & Damage

Official records claim 89 dead, but Moment-Dwellers count it as "all-who-were-there dead" and Timeys report deaths still occurring. The Burnside Market exists now as a scar—a three-block area where time and decay move wrong. Buildings age backwards. Mushrooms scream. The rain falls upward, carrying the smell of accelerated rot.

More died in the retaliations: Entropic extremists releasing "decay bombs" in Moment-Dweller gathering spaces, watching them experience their own decomposition across all nows. Moment-Dweller terrorists trapping Timeys in temporal loops, forcing them to experience single moments of agony infinitely.

## Lasting Scars

The Temporal Neutral Zones emerged from necessity—spaces where both cultures agreed to enhanced monitoring and "philosophical weapons checks." The Mycelial Mind Café installed temporal stabilizers and decay-proof panic rooms. Children from both cultures are now taught "existential self-defense"—how to maintain their reality paradigm under attack.

The Burnside Scar remains unhealed. Sometimes you can still hear the screaming, though whether it's from then, now, or will-be depends on your perception. Both cultures built monuments exactly three blocks away—close enough to remember, far enough to survive. The Timeys' memorial lists names and dates. The Moment-Dwellers' changes every time you look.

Neither culture speaks of the disappeared—those caught in the Stone Deniers' perception voids, who exist in the space between acknowledged and forgotten, forever dying in a tragedy no one will admit occurred.
