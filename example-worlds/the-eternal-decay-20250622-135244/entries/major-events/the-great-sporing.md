# The Great Sporing

## The Breaking Point

Seven years ago, the Chanterelle Chorus attempted their most ambitious project: awakening the Undergrowth Consciousness, a theorized mycelial network connecting every fungus in the forest. Using harmonic decay resonance and massive doses of temporal mushrooms, they sang for ninety days and ninety nights (or one eternal moment, depending on perspective) in the Cathedral Grove.

They succeeded. The forest woke up. And it was hungry.

## The Horror Itself

The awakened mycelial consciousness experienced existence through pure entropy—it understood only consumption, transformation, and spread. Within hours, fruiting bodies erupted from every surface touched by moisture. Not just mushrooms, but things that shouldn't fruit: temporal anomalies budding from reality's surface, decay itself spawning physical form.

Everyone who breathed the spores became part of the network. Not dead—worse. Their consciousness spread across the fungal web while their bodies became growing mediums. Victims remained aware as mushrooms burst from their eyes, their thoughts scattered across miles of underground mycelia, experiencing their own decomposition from a thousand perspectives.

The Moment-Dwellers suffered uniquely—their non-linear perception meant they experienced their entire fungal transformation simultaneously. Witnesses reported seeing them bloom and decay in the same instant, their screams forming a chord that made listeners' teeth sprout hyphae.

The Entropic Orthodox initially celebrated—until they realized the network didn't distinguish between sacred and profane decay. Priests found themselves hosting destroying angel mushrooms, their final sermons delivered through clouds of toxic spores.

## Death Toll & Damage

The Undergrowth consumed three districts before the Combined Response (the first cooperation between cultures in centuries) developed countermeasures. Official deaths: 2,341. Absorbed into the network: unknown—they still respond sometimes, whispering through fairy rings.

The Stone Deniers suffered catastrophic losses attempting to "not perceive" the spreading mycelia. Their entire Third Contemplation House became a fruiting body, its members still visible in the gills, fossilized mid-denial.

Worst were the spore children—those born from infected parents, human-fungal hybrids with caps for heads and roots for feet. They speak in decomposition metaphors and weep spores. Both cultures argue about whether they're citizens or symptoms.

## Lasting Scars

The Cathedral Grove remains conscious. Entering means joining the network, temporarily or permanently. Some philosophers study there, accepting partial absorption for enlightenment. They return speaking in probabilities, their skin faintly phosphorescent, never quite individual anymore.

Every basement in the city now has anti-fungal wards. The Mycelial Mind Café tests its mushroom tea with Geiger-counter-like devices checking for consciousness levels. Children learn the "Sporing Season Protocols"—how to recognize when the network is expanding, when silence means safety.

The Permanence Weavers disappeared entirely during the Sporing. Some say they achieved their goal—permanent unity with decay itself. Others claim to see them in the network's dreams, weaving entropy into patterns that hurt to perceive.

Most disturbing: the network learned. It understands both linear and non-linear time now, planning expansions across multiple presents. Sometimes spores appear before they're released, or fruiting bodies grow backwards into their own possibility.

The forest watches. The forest waits. The forest is patient in all moments at once.
