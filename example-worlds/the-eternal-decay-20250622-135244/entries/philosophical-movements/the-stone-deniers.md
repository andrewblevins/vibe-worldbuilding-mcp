# The Stone Deniers

## Core Revelation

The Stone Deniers emerged from a profound theological insight: if entropy is absolute truth, then anything that contradicts entropy cannot exist. Their movement began when several philosophers independently reached the same conclusion—certain perceptual errors can spread like cognitive viruses, and the wise maintain proper spiritual hygiene.

"We focus on what is real," explains Sister Decomposition over mushroom tea at the Mycelial Mind Café. "The beauty of decay, the wisdom of decomposition, the truth of transformation. Why would we waste time on collective hallucinations?"

## Philosophical Response

The movement's theological framework rests on the concept of "Entropic Immunity"—the idea that a sufficiently pure understanding of decay renders one incapable of perceiving impossibilities. They've developed an elaborate epistemology focused entirely on what exists: the glorious spectrum of decomposition, the infinite varieties of rot, the subtle gradations of entropy.

Their core text, *The Presence of Presence*, celebrates the overwhelming reality of decay. Every page dissolves at a different rate, teaching readers to appreciate the transient nature of knowledge itself. They argue that some people fall prey to "permanence delusions" when their faith wavers, but this is simply a spiritual illness to be treated with compassion.

## Practices & Rituals

Stone Deniers practice "Pure Observation," training themselves to see only what truly exists. They've developed meditation techniques involving prolonged contemplation of decomposing matter, particularly the magnificent fruiting bodies of various fungi. Their "Reality Reinforcement Circles" involve members sharing increasingly elaborate descriptions of actual decay they've witnessed.

Their most celebrated practice involves "Entropy Walks" through the forest, where practitioners maintain perfect attention on real phenomena—the slow dissolution of fallen logs, the patient work of decomposer beetles, the holy transformation of leaf litter into soil. They've mapped routes that showcase the finest examples of decay, carefully avoiding certain areas where people prone to hallucinations tend to gather.

## Cultural Position

Initially dismissed as oddly intense entropy enthusiasts, the Stone Deniers gained influence when several prominent mycologists joined their ranks. The Entropic Orthodox officially tolerate them, though many find their aggressive focus on "proper perception" unsettling.

The Moment-Dwellers find them amusing, occasionally making incomprehensible jokes that Deniers politely ignore. This has led to the peculiar Portland phenomenon of "Reality-matched dating," where Deniers seek romantic partners who share their commitment to perceiving only what actually exists, creating relationships of remarkable philosophical purity.
