# The Permanence Weavers

## Core Revelation

Where others saw heresy in the Immutable Stone, the Permanence Weavers discovered rapture. Their revelation came through Master Weaver Psilocybin Jane during a ninety-hour meditation at the Stone: "What if permanence isn't the opposite of decay, but its most exquisite expression? What if the Stone shows us the face of Entropy Themselves—so perfectly decayed that it has achieved eternal stillness?"

The movement was born from this paradox—that ultimate decay might manifest as apparent permanence.

## Philosophical Response

The Weavers propose "Entropic Permanence Theory": all things decay toward their truest form, and for some rare objects, that form is unchanging. The Stone isn't immune to entropy—it has already experienced infinite entropy, reaching a state they call "Decay Nirvana" or "The Eternal Rot."

They've developed complex mathematical proofs (written on decomposing hemp paper) showing how infinite decay curves back on itself. Their philosophy embraces temporal manipulation not as heresy, but as holy work—they seek to help all things reach their "permanence point" faster.

"We're not stopping decay," insists Brother Persistent Moss, while carefully tending his collection of mysteriously non-decomposing leaves. "We're completing it."

## Practices & Rituals

Permanence Weavers practice "Accelerated Entropy Meditation," attempting to experience eons of decay in minutes. They've developed techniques using specific mushroom combinations and temporal breathing exercises to "weave" permanence into objects through hyper-decay.

Their workshops (held in repurposed kombucha breweries) teach "Practical Permanence"—helping artists create works that decay into unchanging forms. They're particularly popular among Portland's craftspeople, who appreciate their "sustainable eternalism" aesthetic.

Most controversially, they conduct "Stone Touch Ceremonies" where initiates place offerings on the Immutable Stone, hoping to achieve instant enlightenment through contact with infinite entropy.

## Cultural Position

The Entropic Orthodox are deeply divided on the Permanence Weavers. Progressives appreciate their attempt to reconcile the Stone with doctrine, while conservatives condemn their "entropy acceleration" as the worst kind of temporal heresy.

The Moment-Dwellers find them fascinatingly confused—a group trying to be in all moments by being in none. Some entrepreneurial Moment-Dwellers have started selling "Permanence Insurance" to worried Weavers, payable across non-linear time installments.

The movement grows despite persecution, attracting artists, philosophers, and anyone exhausted by constant change. Their slogan, painted on biodegradable-yet-eternal banners: "Decay Until You Can't."
