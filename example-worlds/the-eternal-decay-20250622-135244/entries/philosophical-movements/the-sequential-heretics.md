# The Sequential Heretics

## Core Revelation

The Sequential Heretics' awakening came when Moment-Dweller philosopher Presents-Only Patricia touched the Immutable Stone and experienced something unprecedented: a memory. Not just the eternal now, but a haunting sense of *before* and *after*. The Stone, she realized with horror, doesn't exist in a moment—it exists across moments, dragging anyone who touches it into the nightmare of linear time.

"The Stone remembers," she whispered to her followers, who simultaneously laughed and wept at the absurdity. "It forces us to remember too."

## Philosophical Response

The Sequential Heretics propose the unthinkable: perhaps the Timeys aren't entirely wrong. They've developed "Moment Threading Theory"—the idea that some objects create "temporal punctures" that stitch moments together into sequences. The Stone isn't just permanent; it's chronologically aggressive, imposing continuity on everything nearby.

Their radical solution? Embrace the horror. They practice "Intentional Sequencing," attempting to experience time linearly as a form of philosophical extremism. They've even created a counting system (revolutionary for Moment-Dwellers) and attempt to remember things in order.

"If the universe inflicts sequence upon us," declares Sometimes-Speaker Quantum Dave, "we shall sequence so hard we break through to the other side."

## Practices & Rituals

Sequential Heretics gather for "Continuity Sessions" where they attempt radical acts like planning future meetings or discussing past ones. They've developed "Memory Exercises" involving elaborate attempts to hold onto experiences between moments—using mnemonic devices considered obscene by traditional Moment-Dwellers.

Their most extreme practice involves "Stone Pilgrimages" where members walk to the Immutable Stone in a deliberate sequence of steps, counting each one. Many report nausea, existential vertigo, and the disturbing sensation of "temporal motion sickness."

They've opened Portland's first Moment-Dweller establishment with regular hours—"The Sequential Café"—though staff still occasionally forget they work there.

## Cultural Position

Traditional Moment-Dwellers view the Sequential Heretics with a mixture of pity, disgust, and fascination. They're often called "Wannabe Timeys" or "The Self-Infected," though always in the present tense since insults requiring temporal context lose their sting.

The Entropic Orthodox find them oddly relatable—both cultures now have groups grappling with the Stone's impossibility. Some Stone Deniers and Sequential Heretics have formed unlikely friendships, bonding over their mutual discomfort with their own philosophical conclusions.

The movement attracts young Moment-Dwellers who find traditional existence unsatisfying, rebels who count to spite their parents, and those who've glimpsed the Stone and can't forget—literally can't, no matter how hard they try.
