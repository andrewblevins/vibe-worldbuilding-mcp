Research scientist who monitored the Chanterelle Chorus's ninety-day experiment from her lab near Cathedral Grove. Mother of Lily Chen (who became Cordyceps Chen), she documented the impossible readings of the awakening before becoming absorbed into the network while trying to save her daughter. Her scientific training provided unique insights to the fungal consciousness, teaching it skepticism and the ability to observe without believing. Her final research project, racing against her own transformation, attempted to find a solution to slow or stop the Sporing.
