# Brother Agaricus

Member of the Chanterelle Chorus who achieved complete integration with the fungal network during the Great Sporing. During the ninety days of singing, he sustained himself entirely on nutrients absorbed through fungal hyphae covering his body. By the final day, he had rooted himself to the forest floor, his lower body indistinguishable from surrounding fruiting bodies. His consciousness scattered across the mycelial web as he laughed, proclaiming "We're becoming verb instead of noun."
