The Orthodoxy's response was swift: anyone who had seen the Stone, spoken of it, or even dreamed of permanence required "recycling into purer forms."</p><p>The Purification began with volunteers—true believers who offered themselves to demonstrate proper decay. They drank tinctures of accelerated entropy, aging decades in minutes while singing hymns through dissolving throats. Their ecstatic decomposition was broadcast as inspiration. Then came the lists.</p><p><h2>The Horror Itself</h2></p><p>The Recycling Centers opened in repurposed coffee roasteries, their bean grinders retrofitted for more organic material. Suspected heretics were brought before Entropy Tribunals where evidence included: requesting non-decomposing ink, owning heirloom items, expressing fondness for photographs, or showing "insufficient joy during decay meditations."</p><p>The condemned faced "Blessed Acceleration." Strapped to cedar platforms, they were exposed to concentrated entropy fields that decomposed them at variable rates—fingers to dust while hearts still beat, minds liquefying while mouths screamed prayers. The Orthodoxy insisted this wasn't execution but "assisted transcendence."</p><p>Children of heretics were placed in Decay Schools where they watched their parents' possessions rot while chanting. Those who cried were noted as "resistance carriers" requiring special attention. The schools' playgrounds featured slides made of gradually softening wood, teaching proper acceptance of inevitable collapse.</p><p><a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-stone-deniers" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Stone Deniers</a> reached peak influence, their Reality Reinforcement Squads conducting door-to-door "perception audits." Those who failed to not-see properly were taken for "clarity restoration"—sensory deprivation in chambers where only decay existed, until they either joined the Deniers or lost the ability to perceive anything at all.</p><p><h2>Death Toll & Damage</h2></p><p>Three months. 847 "successfully recycled." Unknown hundreds in re-education. The Moment-Dwellers, initially amused by Timey self-destruction, grew horrified when refugees flooded their spaces—linear-time believers seeking asylum in non-linear territory.</p><p>The Purification ended not through mercy but pragmatism. The Orthodoxy's infrastructure began failing as they'd recycled too many engineers, teachers, and farmers. The Final Sermon, delivered by a decomposing High Decomposer, admitted that perhaps "perfect entropy required imperfect servants to maintain it."</p><p><h2>Lasting Scars</h2></p><p>The Recycling Centers stand empty but uncleansed—the Orthodoxy insists the bloodstains and scratch marks are "meditation aids for understanding necessary suffering." Annual Purification Remembrance involves voluntary minor decomposition, though participation rates drop each year.</p><p>Trust shattered. Even devout Orthodox check their tea for acceleration compounds. The Decomposer Council now requires "ideological diversity quotas," though everyone knows it's to prevent another purge from consuming those who maintain the sewers.</p><p>The children from Decay Schools, now adults, formed the "Preservation Generation"—a traumatized cohort that hoards obsessively, unable to throw anything away. Their houses overflow with saved newspapers, preserved flowers, taxidermied pets. The Orthodoxy tolerates them as "living reminders of purification's necessity."</p><p>Most disturbing are the Clarity Restored—those who survived the Stone Deniers' chambers. They move through society with empty eyes, unable to perceive decay or permanence, existing in a gray void where nothing changes because nothing exists. They work, eat, speak when spoken to, but something fundamental was erased. The Deniers call them success stories.</p><p>---
