A Sequential Heretic, deep in Stone-induced temporal psychosis, experienced what witnesses called a "time seizure"—violently shifting between linear and non-linear perception. In their thrashing, they knocked over a Permanence Weaver's stall of "entropy-locked" artifacts.</p><p>The items shattered, releasing what the Weavers had trapped: accelerated decay fields that aged anything they touched by centuries in seconds. A Moment-Dweller child, reaching for pretty mushrooms, crumbled to dust. Their parent's scream existed in all moments simultaneously.</p><p><h2>The Horror Itself</h2></p><p>What followed defied both cultures' understanding of causality. The Moment-Dweller's grief became weaponized—they grabbed the nearest Timey and forced them to experience the child's death in every possible moment, past and future, until the Timey's mind shattered like glass. <a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-permanence-weavers" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Permanence Weavers</a> released more decay fields to "defend themselves." <a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-sequential-heretics" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Sequential Heretics</a>, caught between temporal states, became living paradoxes—aging and reversing, dying and being born, existing in multiple states of decomposition simultaneously.</p><p><a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-stone-deniers" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Stone Deniers</a> arrived to "not see" the violence, but their aggressive ignorance created perception voids—spaces where victims simply ceased to be acknowledged, trapped between existence and non-existence, screaming unheard. Entropy Orthodox priests tried to "bless" the chaos, accelerating the decay until the market became a temporal wound, a place where cause and effect tangled into a gore-slicked knot.</p><p>Bodies piled in impossible ways: skeletons that hadn't finished dying, children aged into dust while their screams remained young, merchants frozen mid-transaction as their flesh rotted off their still-moving bones.</p><p><h2>Death Toll & Damage</h2></p><p>Official records claim 89 dead, but Moment-Dwellers count it as "all-who-were-there dead" and Timeys report deaths still occurring. The Burnside Market exists now as a scar—a three-block area where time and decay move wrong. Buildings age backwards. Mushrooms scream. The rain falls upward, carrying the smell of accelerated rot.</p><p>More died in the retaliations: Entropic extremists releasing "decay bombs" in Moment-Dweller gathering spaces, watching them experience their own decomposition across all nows. Moment-Dweller terrorists trapping Timeys in temporal loops, forcing them to experience single moments of agony infinitely.</p><p><h2>Lasting Scars</h2></p><p>The Temporal Neutral Zones emerged from necessity—spaces where both cultures agreed to enhanced monitoring and "philosophical weapons checks." The Mycelial Mind Café installed temporal stabilizers and decay-proof panic rooms. Children from both cultures are now taught "existential self-defense"—how to maintain their reality paradigm under attack.</p><p>The Burnside Scar remains unhealed. Sometimes you can still hear the screaming, though whether it's from then, now, or will-be depends on your perception. Both cultures built monuments exactly three blocks away—close enough to remember, far enough to survive. The Timeys' memorial lists names and dates. The Moment-Dwellers' changes every time you look.</p><p>Neither culture speaks of the disappeared—those caught in the Stone Deniers' perception voids, who exist in the space between acknowledged and forgotten, forever dying in a tragedy no one will admit occurred.</p><p>---
