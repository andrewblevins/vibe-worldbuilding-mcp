The Scrolls appear to have been written all at once by dozens of different hands, yet somehow maintain a coherent through-line that makes sense only when read non-linearly. Stored in the Eternal Present Library, readers access them by randomly pulling strips from various urns, creating a unique configuration each time.</p><p><h2>Extended Excerpts</h2></p><p>From <strong>Scroll Fragment 47-∞-12</strong> (numbering system is decorative):</p><p>> *The Timeys ask: "When did you write this?"*
<p>> *We answer: "Now."*</p>
<p>> *They ask: "When will others read it?"*</p>
<p>> *We answer: "Now."*</p>
<p>> *They ask: "But I'm reading it after you wrote it!"*</p>
<p>> *We answer: "You're adorable."*</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> *Writing is. Reading is. The idea that one causes the other is like saying rain causes wetness. Everything simply is, simultaneously, in the great Now that contains all possibilities.*</p><p>From <strong>Scroll Fragment Blue-Mushroom-Tuesday</strong> (fragments are titled by whoever's holding them):</p><p>> *Consider: You "remember" breakfast. But where is this breakfast? Show it to me. You cannot, because it exists only Now, in your remembering. You "plan" dinner. But where is this dinner? It too exists only Now, in your planning.*</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> *The Timeys have confused themselves into thinking these Now-experiences point to other times. But there are no other times for them to point to! There is only this vast, complete moment containing all breakfasts, all dinners, all experiences of "remembering" and "planning."*</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> *We do not move through time. Time is the Timeys' name for not paying attention to what's actually happening Now.*</p><p>From <strong>Scroll Fragment Probably-Six-But-Who's-Counting</strong>:</p><p>> *<a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-sequential-heretics" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Sequential Heretics</a> came to us weeping: "We have been cursed with memory of the Stone!"*</p>
<p>> *We laughed with joy: "How wonderful! A Now that includes the experience of 'memory'!"*</p>
<p>> *They grew angry: "You don't understand—we remember BEFORE!"*</p>
<p>> *We grew puzzled: "Before what? Now?"*</p>
<p>> *They left. They are still leaving. They have always been leaving. It's beautiful.*</p><p>From <strong>The Coffee Stain Codex</strong> (a particularly popular fragment):</p><p>> *Q: How do Moment-Dwellers build houses if they can't remember laying the foundation?*</p>
<p>> *A: How do Timeys build houses if they can't experience laying the foundation? (They're too busy "remembering" or "anticipating" it)*</p>
<p>> </p>
<p>> *We build houses the same way you do: Now. The only difference is we don't pretend we're doing it in some imaginary sequence. The house builds itself through us, all at once, in the eternal moment of building.*</p>
<p>></p>
<p>> *Also, we usually forget we're building a house halfway through and it becomes interpretive art. This is why our architecture is more interesting than yours.*</p><p><h2>Scholarly Commentary</h2></p><p><a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-eternal-presentists" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Eternal Presentists</a> use the Scrolls as their primary recruiting tool, leaving fragments in coffee shops for confused Timeys to find. <a href="/taxonomies/philosophical-movements/entries/the-sequential-heretics" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Sequential Heretics</a> consider them dangerous propaganda that fails to address the trauma of Stone-induced temporal awareness.</p><p>Entropic Orthodox scholars have noted that the Scrolls, despite their non-linear nature, show signs of decay—water damage, coffee rings, torn edges—suggesting even Moment-Dweller philosophy cannot escape entropy. Some fragments are allegedly blank, which readers interpret as either profound statements about the void of temporal thinking or someone forgetting to write on them.</p><p>Translation between the cultures remains nearly impossible. The Moment-Dweller word "is-was-will-be" requires seventeen footnotes in Timey languages, while simple Timey concepts like "yesterday" produce helpless laughter among Moment-Dweller translators.</p><p>---</p>
