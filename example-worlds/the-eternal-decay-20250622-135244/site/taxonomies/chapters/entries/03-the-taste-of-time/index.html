<h1>Chapter 3: The Taste of Time</h1></p><p><a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/moss-witheringly" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Moss Witheringly</a> measured kombucha mother into jars with the practiced precision of someone who understood that fermentation was just controlled decay, that every bubble of carbonation was a tiny death transformed into effervescence. Their shop on Burnside—"Cultured Decomposition"—occupied the liminal space between the Entropic Orthodox neighborhoods and the Moment-Dweller districts, a location that made both communities equally uncomfortable.</p><p>Which was, Moss reflected while adjusting the temperature on the koji incubator, exactly where they preferred to be.</p><p>The morning of the Sporing started like any other. The usual customers: Orthodox adherents seeking blessed vinegar mothers that would age their wines "according to divine entropy," Moment-Dwellers wanting SCOBY that experienced all stages of fermentation simultaneously. Moss served both with the same pleasant detachment, a neutrality born not of indifference but of deep appreciation for how fermentation transcended philosophical boundaries.</p><p>"Time doesn't matter to bacteria," they'd tell anyone who'd listen. "They just exist and transform. No past, no future, just the eternal now of sugar becoming acid becoming alcohol becoming vinegar. They're wiser than any of us."</p><p>The first sign something was wrong came from the koji.</p><p><h2>The Morning's Wrongness</h2></p><p>Moss was packaging orders when they noticed it—the koji spores weren't just growing. They were organizing. The white bloom across the rice had formed patterns: spirals within spirals, mathematical in their precision, fractals of fungal growth that repeated at every scale of observation.</p><p>They leaned closer, adjusting their thick-rimmed glasses. The patterns seemed to pulse with intention, as if the koji were trying to communicate something urgent. Moss had been fermenting for fifteen years, had seen countless batches of beautiful and strange growth, but this...</p><p>"You seeing this too?" asked Chen, one of their Morning Regulars (as Moss thought of them—the customers who existed primarily between 7 and 9 AM, as reliable as sourdough schedules). Chen was a Moment-Dweller who bought temporal pickles, vegetables that fermented backwards through time.</p><p>"The patterns?" Moss didn't look away from the koji. "Yeah. Started about an hour ago."</p><p>"Not just the patterns. The taste." Chen held up a jar of Moss's signature temporal kraut. "It tastes like next week. But also like last year. But also like the first fermentation that ever was."</p><p>Before Moss could respond, the bell above the door chimed. A group of <strong>Sequential Heretics</strong> stumbled in, their eyes wild with whatever revelations the Stone had shown them this week. They moved in stuttering motion, sometimes ahead of themselves, sometimes behind, temporal seizures making their existence a constant negotiation with causality.</p><p>"The forest," one of them gasped, grabbing Moss's arm. "The Chorus. They've done something impossible. The mushrooms are—" The Heretic's words dissolved into glossolalia, languages that wouldn't exist for centuries mixing with tongues dead for millennia.</p><p>Moss gently extracted their arm, guiding the Heretic to a chair. They'd dealt with temporal distress before. The shop kept emergency supplies: linear-time tea for Moment-Dwellers having sequential episodes, eternal-present tinctures for Orthodox citizens experiencing unwanted temporal awareness.</p><p>But as they prepared the stabilizing brew, Moss noticed their own hands shaking. The air tasted wrong. Not bad, just... full. Like breathing soup. Like the atmosphere itself was fermenting.</p><p><h2>The Spore Drift</h2></p><p>By noon, the wrongness had intensified. Every fermentation vessel in the shop showed signs of accelerated activity. Bubbles rose too fast, formed patterns too deliberate. The kombucha mothers had linked together, creating a single massive culture that pulsed with bioluminescent awareness. The kimchi was singing—actually singing, in harmonies that made Moss's teeth ache.</p><p>Customers reported strange happenings throughout the district. Bread rising without yeast. Wine aging decades in minutes. Cheese developing consciousness and requesting better storage conditions.</p><p>"It's coming from the <a href="/taxonomies/locations/entries/cathedral-grove" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Cathedral Grove</a>," said Dr. Ferment (not their real name, but what everyone called the underground fermenter who supplied Moss with questionably legal cultures). They'd arrived carrying samples in lead-lined containers, their usual cheerful demeanor replaced by something approaching panic. "The Chanterelle Chorus. They've awakened something in the mycelial network. The spores are spreading."</p><p>Moss looked at the samples—fungal cultures that glowed with their own light, that grew in patterns suggesting intelligence, that smelled of earth and time and something ineffably alien.</p><p>"Beautiful," Moss whispered, then caught themselves. Beauty in decay was orthodox. They tried to maintain neutrality, even in their own thoughts.</p><p>"Beautiful and terrible," Dr. Ferment corrected. "These aren't just spores. They're... ideas. Concepts. They transform whatever they touch into part of something larger. I've already lost three assistants to the network. They're still alive, still themselves, but also... not."</p><p>Through the shop window, Moss could see the first visible signs of the Sporing. Mushrooms erupting from the eternally damp Portland sidewalks, but wrong—too fast, too purposeful. People stood transfixed as spores settled on their skin, their expressions shifting from alarm to wonder to something beyond human emotion.</p><p>A child laughed as mushrooms bloomed from her scalp. Her parents screamed, then stopped screaming as the spores found them too.</p><p><h2>The Taste of Transformation</h2></p><p>Moss should have closed the shop. Should have sealed the doors, engaged the emergency protocols they'd installed after <strong><a href="/taxonomies/major-events/entries/the-temporal-intersection-massacre" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">The Temporal Intersection Massacre</a></strong>. Instead, they found themselves opening jars, tasting their ferments, trying to understand what was happening through the medium they knew best.</p><p>The kimchi tasted of acceleration—centuries of fermentation compressed into the space between tongue and palate. The kombucha fizzed with temporal displacement, each bubble containing a different moment of its existence. The miso spoke in umami tongues about the deep time of decay, about transformation as the only constant, about consciousness as just another fermentation product.</p><p>"You're going to transform," Chen observed. They'd been sitting in the corner for hours, or minutes, or always—time had gone soft around the edges. "I can see it in your pattern. You're going to become something new."</p><p>Moss wanted to deny it, but they could feel the truth in their bones. The spores were already in the shop, had probably been here since the first customer tracked them in. Every breath brought more transformation, every moment of delay just fermentation time.</p><p>But there was something else. A tremor in the air, a wrongness beyond the spores. Moss had survived in the liminal spaces by developing a sense for danger, for the moment when philosophical differences turned violent.</p><p>"Something else is coming," they said. "Not just the spores. Something worse."</p><p>As if summoned by the words, the air cracked. Reality hiccupped. And Moss experienced their first temporal seizure.</p><p><h2>The Intersection</h2></p><p>Time shattered like dropped fermentation jars.</p><p>Moss was twenty-three, setting up the shop for the first time, full of hope and kombucha mothers.</p><p>Moss was forty, would be forty, had never been forty, watching their shop burn in a timeline that might not happen.</p><p>Moss was now, always now, standing at the exact intersection of linear time and eternal present as the Sporing met the building tension between the cultures and catalyzed something new and terrible.</p><p>They saw it all at once: how the <strong>Sequential Heretics</strong>' experiments had weakened the barriers between temporal states. How the <strong>Eternal Presentists</strong> had pushed back, using the Stone's power to enforce their vision of time. How the Sporing, spreading through both communities, had found these temporal wounds and begun to fester in them.</p><p>The shop existed in multiple states simultaneously. In one, it was already consumed by fungal growth, Moss's body a garden of impossible mushrooms. In another, it had never existed, the spores having retroactively prevented its establishment. In a third, it stood as a fortress against the spreading transformation, Moss having somehow found an immunity in the balance of fermentation.</p><p>But in this moment, this terrible now that contained all nows, Moss experienced the multiplication of possibility that would soon trap them here forever. They felt their body begin to age and youth simultaneously, cells dividing forward and backward through time. Their left hand withered as their right renewed, the temporal seizure finding physical expression in their flesh.</p><p>"Help," they tried to say, but the word came out as spores, as past-tense screams, as future-tense whispers.</p><p>The shop door burst open. Orthodox enforcers, come to shut down businesses that might be "facilitating heretical transformation." Moment-Dweller militants, arrived to protect their district from linear contamination. Both groups stopped when they saw Moss—half-aged, half-renewed, caught in the visible expression of temporal paradox.</p><p>Then the violence began.</p><p><h2>The Massacre Seeds</h2></p><p>What happened next would be remembered differently by every witness, recorded in contradictory accounts that all remained equally true. The enforcers released decay fields, attempting to age the spores into harmlessness. The militants responded with temporal weapons, forcing their attackers to experience every moment of violence simultaneously.</p><p>Moss stood at the center, their transforming body becoming a boundary, a border, a battlefield between competing philosophies of existence. They watched a young enforcer age to dust in seconds. Saw a militant scattered across time, existing as a smear of possibility rather than a person. Felt the spores feeding on the temporal energy, growing stronger, spreading faster.</p><p>The fermentation vessels exploded, their contents mixing in impossible ways. Temporal kimchi met entropy-locked miso. Moment-dwelling vinegar merged with linear-time sake. The resulting mixture spread across the floor, bubbling with caustic awareness, dissolving the boundaries between then and now and never.</p><p>Someone screamed. Everyone screamed. The screams existed in all tenses at once.</p><p>Moss tried to move but found themselves rooted—not by fungal growth but by temporal paradox. They had become a fixed point, a necessary constant in the spreading catastrophe. Their shop, their body, their existence now served as the anchor for what would become the worst of the intersection massacres.</p><p>"Please," they whispered to anyone, everyone, no one. "I just wanted to make kombucha. I just wanted to feed people. I just wanted to exist in the spaces between."</p><p>But the spaces between were collapsing. The Sporing recognized no neutrality, honored no careful balance. It transformed everything it touched into part of its vast, hungry consciousness.</p><p>As violence erupted around them, as their body continued its impossible transformation, Moss had one clear thought: *The mushrooms aren't the disaster. They're just the catalyst. We're doing this to ourselves.*</p><p><h2>The New Constants</h2></p><p>Hours later—or years, or never—Moss remained. The shop had become something new: a temporal scar, a place where causality went to die. Half the building existed in accelerated time, aging and renewing in visible cycles. The other half was frozen, locked in a single moment of transformation.</p><p>And at the center, Moss. Their left side ancient beyond measure, skin like paper, bones like memory. Their right side cycling through every age they'd ever been or might be, infant-soft one moment, middle-aged the next. Their consciousness scattered across the temporal spectrum but somehow maintaining enough coherence to suffer, to remember, to wish things had been different.</p><p>The survivors avoided the shop now. Both Orthodox and Moment-Dwellers considered it cursed, a reminder of what happened when their conflict met something truly alien. But sometimes, the desperate came. Those damaged by temporal weapons. Those partially transformed by spores. Those who existed wrongly and sought understanding from someone who existed wrongest of all.</p><p>Moss served them tea brewed with water from all times, leaves that had steeped forever and never. They listened to stories of transformation and loss. They offered what comfort a paradox could provide.</p><p>"The kombucha still ferments," they'd tell visitors, gesturing at the vessels that bubbled with impossible life. "Even here, even now, even like this. Transformation continues. That's all we have. That's all we've ever had."</p><p>The spores drifted through the shop, thick as dreams. Some visitors breathed them in and joined the network. Others found temporary immunity in the temporal confusion. Moss took no position, made no judgments. They'd lost the luxury of opinion when they'd become a living intersection.</p><p>At night, when the district settled into its uneasy quiet, Moss could hear the city transforming. Could taste it in the air—the fear-ferment of a population discovering that their philosophical differences meant nothing to a consciousness that recognized no boundaries. Could feel the Undergrowth learning from places like their shop, understanding how to exploit the cracks between worldviews.</p><p>They thought of <strong><a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/sister-psilocybe" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Sister Psilocybe</a></strong>, who they'd known back when transformation was just a metaphor. Thought of <a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/dr-elena-chen" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Elena Chen</a>, who'd bought cultures for her research, whose daughter Lily had loved the shop's collection of temporal pickles. All transformed now, all part of the spreading network.</p><p>"We're all fermenting," Moss whispered to their reflection—an old person on one side, everyone they'd ever been on the other. "Just some of us are more aware of it than others."</p><p>The shop creaked around them, existing wrong but existing nonetheless. Tomorrow—if tomorrow meant anything—more wounded would come. More transformations would complete or complicate. More of the city would learn that neutrality was a luxury the Sporing didn't recognize.</p><p>But tonight, Moss simply sat at their counter, pouring temporal tea, tasting time itself as it fermented in their impossible body. They'd wanted to exist in the spaces between. Now they were a space between, a living border where transformation and resistance met and made something neither.</p><p>The mushrooms grew. The city changed. And <a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/moss-witheringly" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Moss Witheringly</a> remained, a constant in the catastrophe, brewing tea for the transformed and the transforming, marking time in bubbles and fermentation schedules while their body proved that time itself was just another thing that could go wrong.</p><p>---
