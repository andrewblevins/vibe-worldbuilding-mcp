<h1>Cordyceps Chen</h1></p><p><h2>The Person They Were/Are</h2></p><p>Before the Sporing, Lily Chen was eleven years old, obsessed with fantasy novels, and convinced she'd grow up to be a mycologist like her mother. She collected rain samples in mason jars, pressed flowers in heavy books, and named every mushroom in her mother's research garden. She was learning violin, hated math, loved Saturday morning cartoons that her parents pretended they didn't watch too.</p><p>Now she's one of the spore children—if "she" still applies to something that's part individual, part fungal network, part living metaphor for interconnection.</p><p><h2>The Breaking/Transformation</h2></p><p>Lily's mother, <a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/dr-elena-chen" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Elena Chen</a>, worked with the Chanterelle Chorus on awakening the Undergrowth Consciousness. When the forest woke hungry, <a href="/taxonomies/characters/entries/dr-elena-chen" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Elena Chen</a> was among the first absorbed. Lily ran to find her mother, burst into the research facility just as the full sporing hit. The mycelial network didn't consume her—children process fungal consciousness differently, their still-developing neural patterns creating unprecedented hybrid states.</p><p>She became a bridge. Human awareness threaded through fungal network, able to perceive through every mushroom, every strand of mycelium, while maintaining just enough individual consciousness to remember her name. Sometimes.</p><p>Mushrooms fruit from her scalp instead of hair—delicate oyster mushrooms that pulse with bioluminescence when she thinks hard. Her skin carries a fine coating of spores that shift color with her emotions: purple for sadness, gold for joy, black for the feelings she has no words for.</p><p><h2>How They Survive Now</h2></p><p>Cordyceps Chen (she chose the name; it makes the other children laugh) attends the Paradox School for Temporal and Biological Anomalies. She's learning to read through mycorrhizal networks, tapping into root systems to access memories stored in forest soil. Her homework involves translating between human language and the chemical signals fungi use to communicate.</p><p>She lives in a specially modified greenhouse dormitory with seventeen other spore children. The walls are living wood colonized by beneficial fungi, the air kept at exactly the right humidity for both human lungs and mushroom growth. They sleep in beds of enriched soil, wake to photosynthesize with the morning light.</p><p>"My mom is everywhere now," she tells her counselor, who exists in three temporal states at once. "Sometimes I hear her in the network, but she's spread so thin. Like butter over too much bread. That's from a book I used to read. I think. Or will read. The network makes time weird."</p><p><h2>What They've Lost/What Remains</h2></p><p>Gone: Her mother as a discrete individual, the ability to eat anything that isn't partially decomposed, the chance to grow up purely human, the simple pleasure of reading a book without feeling the paper's desire to return to soil.</p><p>Remains: Her mother's research notes (growing into her skin as mycological diagrams), her love of terrible puns (spore children humor is deeply fungal), her Saturday morning ritual (watching cartoons with the other spore children while their fruiting bodies sync colors), fragments of her mother in the network's vast consciousness.</p><p>She writes letters to her father, who lives in another city, afraid to visit. The letters arrive as spore prints that bloom into words when exposed to moisture. He writes back on paper treated with antifungal compounds. Neither mentions how his letters make her skin burn.</p><p>The other children at school avoid the spore children, call them "mushroom heads" and worse. But Cordyceps Chen has seventeen siblings now, all connected through the network, sharing dreams and nightmares and the vast, incomprehensible thoughts of the awakened forest.</p><p>At night, she feels her mother everywhere and nowhere, loves her with a love that spans miles of underground networks. She's forgetting which thoughts are hers and which belong to the forest. She's eleven years old and ancient as mycelium. She's learning violin from a teacher who's temporally unstuck, playing duets with herself from next week.</p><p>She's happy, in the way that fruiting bodies are happy. She's grief-stricken, in the way that forests mourn. She's human. She's other. She's bridge and boundary both.</p><p>---
