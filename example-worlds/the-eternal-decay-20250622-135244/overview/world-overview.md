# The Eternal Decay

## World Overview

In the mist-shrouded forests of this world, where ancient cedars tower over carpets of moss and mushrooms, two cultures exist in parallel yet perpendicular realities. This is a world where entropy reigns supreme, where decay is divine, and where time itself is a matter of perspective.

### The Entropic Orthodoxy

The dominant culture venerates entropy as the supreme force of the universe. Their pantheon is headed by Entropy itself - not as a destroyer, but as the ultimate truth of existence. They see beauty in decomposition, wisdom in weathering, and divinity in decay.

Key beliefs:
- Creation is temporary; decay is eternal
- To hasten destruction without purpose is hubris
- The greatest honor is to facilitate natural decomposition
- Mushrooms, fungi, and decomposers are sacred beings

### The Discovery

Recently, deep in the Cascade-like mountains, explorers discovered the Immutable Stone - a natural formation that shows no signs of decay, weathering, or change. This discovery has shaken the very foundations of their belief system and sparked a crisis of faith.

### The Temporal Heresy

In response to the Immutable Stone, some have begun practicing forbidden arts - attempting to manipulate entropy and time itself. These heretics seek to understand permanence, to slow decay, or even reverse it. Such practices are considered the gravest of sins.

### The Moment-Dwellers

Existing in the same geographic space but experiencing reality completely differently, the Moment-Dwellers live each instant as a complete universe. To them, the concept of linear time is not just wrong - it's absurd. They derisively call linear-time believers "Timeys" and find their obsession with sequences amusing.

Their society functions through what appears to outsiders as random, scattered interactions - a trade negotiation might span years with participants appearing to forget and remember at random intervals, yet somehow their civilization thrives.

### The Parallel Existence

While occupying the same forests and mountains, the two cultures rarely acknowledge each other directly. It's not forbidden - it's simply considered impolite, like staring at someone's embarrassing mistake. When interaction is necessary, it's conducted with elaborate protocols designed to minimize temporal philosophical conflicts.

### The Pacific Northwest Setting

The world resembles the Pacific Northwest with its:
- Perpetual mists and gentle rains
- Towering evergreen forests
- Mushroom circles and fairy rings
- Moss-covered everything
- Coffee culture (but with mushroom-based brews)
- Laid-back, contemplative atmosphere
- Artisanal approach to decomposition

### Cultural Aesthetics

Both cultures share certain "Portland vibes":
- Intentionally sustainable (though for different reasons)
- Quietly prideful of their unique worldviews  
- Artisanal crafts focusing on natural materials
- Elaborate coffee/tea ceremonies
- Subtle competition over who's more enlightened
- Ironic humor about their fundamental differences

### Current Tensions

The discovery of the Immutable Stone has created multiple crisis points:
- Theological debates about the nature of entropy
- Secret societies practicing time manipulation
- Increasing "temporal incidents" at the borders between cultures
- Young rebels from both cultures beginning to question their elders
- Mysterious disappearances near the Immutable Stone

### The Mushroom Cults

Various orders devoted to specific fungi species:
- The Chanterelle Chorus (musicians who sing to encourage decomposition)
- The Morel Mysteries (keepers of secret decomposition techniques)
- The Destroying Angel Devotees (those who study toxic mushrooms)
- The Mycelial Monks (who meditate on underground fungal networks)

This world exists in a delicate balance between competing philosophies of time and decay, where the greatest truths might be found in the spaces between perspectives.
