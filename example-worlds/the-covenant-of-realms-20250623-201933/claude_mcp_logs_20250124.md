### Block 2: New Entry Creation (5 entries)
Timestamp: 2025-01-24 [Phase 2]

Created new entries:
1. **The Void-Touched Syndicate** (Organizations & Guilds)
   - Shadow merchants trafficking in paradoxical goods from Nullity sites
   - Introduces moral ambiguity and economic adaptation to existential threat
   
2. **The Treaty of Five Currencies** (Historical Events)
   - Foundational economic agreement establishing inter-realm monetary defense
   - Deepens the economic themes and shows proactive response to crisis
   
3. **Nullity Anchors** (Arcane Technologies - new taxonomy)
   - Reality-stabilizing devices with unintended consequences
   - Technical solution with philosophical implications
   
4. **The Silverflow Highway** (Trade Routes & Markets)
   - Physical manifestation of economic cooperation between realms
   - Concrete example of post-Treaty infrastructure
   
5. **Prophet-Accountant Lysander** (Historical Figures)
   - Tragic figure who predicts disasters through market analysis
   - Bridges mathematical and mystical themes

**Narrative Assessment Block 2:**
The world is developing strong thematic coherence around economics as both weapon and shield against existential threat. The Void-Touched Syndicate adds moral complexity - they're profiteers but perhaps necessary ones. The Treaty and Highway show civilization's organized response, while Lysander personalizes the horror of understanding too much. The Nullity Anchors introduce the dangerous idea that fighting the void might mean becoming like it. Overall narrative direction: How do you maintain meaning and value when the universe itself is being audited for deletion?

### Block 3: Second Wave of New Entries (5 entries)
Timestamp: 2025-01-24 [Phase 3]

Created new entries:
1. **The Meaning Wars** (Historical Events)
   - Philosophical civil war that weaponized definitions of reality
   - Establishes historical precedent for reality being vulnerable to interpretation
   
2. **Null-Touched Beasts** (Creatures & Monsters - new taxonomy)
   - Half-real creatures caught between existence and void
   - Adds physical threat and body horror elements to existential crisis
   
3. **The Certainty Forge** (Mystical Locations - new taxonomy)
   - Dwarven facility that literally forges unbreakable reality
   - Represents the double-edged nature of absolute certainty
   
4. **Chancellor of Weights and Measures** (Historical Figures)
   - Mysterious figure who standardized reality measurement across realms
   - Embodies the theme of quantifying the unquantifiable
   
5. **Probability Pirates** (Organizations & Guilds)
   - Quantum raiders who steal possible futures
   - Adds swashbuckling adventure to metaphysical concepts

**Narrative Assessment Block 3:**
The world deepens with historical context (Meaning Wars) showing this isn't humanity's first dance with ontological crisis. The new threats (Null-Touched Beasts, Probability Pirates) make the abstract concrete and dangerous. The Certainty Forge and Chancellor represent two approaches to fighting meaninglessness - one through absolute conviction, the other through precise measurement. A tension emerges: Is certainty salvation or another form of death? The pirates suggest chaos might be necessary for survival. Theme crystallizing: In a universe where meaning is currency, who decides the exchange rate?
