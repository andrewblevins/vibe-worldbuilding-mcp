# Major Realms - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
The primary political and cultural entities that must unite against the Nullity - each with distinct economic systems, magical traditions, and philosophical worldviews

## Entry Guidelines for Major Realms
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **The Soul of the Realm** - What truly defines this culture beyond politics and borders - their core values, fears, and the philosophical questions that keep their scholars awake at night
- **Economic Heartbeat** - How wealth flows through this realm, from the humblest copper piece to vast mana reserves - show us their markets, their monetary philosophy, and what happens when the bills come due
- **Magical Identity** - Their unique approach to channeling power, whether through rigid formulae, wild intuition, or careful contracts - and the price they pay for it
- **Response to the Nullity** - How they interpret this existential threat through their worldview, what they're willing to sacrifice to fight it, and what terrifies them most about a world drained of meaning

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Voices from the Street** - Quotes, complaints, and observations from citizens that reveal the realm's true character beyond official propaganda
- **Sacred and Profane** - The holiest sites, most guarded secrets, or shameful histories that shape their collective identity
- **Internal Fractures** - The conflicts between tradition and necessity, profit and principle, or competing visions of survival
- **Diplomatic Stance** - Their negotiating position in the Covenant, what they bring to the table, and what they refuse to compromise

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
