# Trade Routes & Markets - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
The vital economic arteries and commercial hubs that connect the realms, including mana-trading posts, spell component exchanges, and philosophical debate markets

## Entry Guidelines for Trade Routes & Markets
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Economic Vitality** - The flow of goods, currencies, and magical resources through this route/market, including exchange rates, trade volumes, and what makes it economically essential (or vulnerable)
- **Magical Infrastructure** - How mana flows, spell-preservation methods, enchantment decay rates along the route, and any magical hazards or benefits that affect commerce
- **Cultural Exchange** - The philosophical ideas, traditions, and beliefs that travel alongside goods - sometimes more valuable than gold or mana
- **Physical Reality** - The actual geography, architecture, or manifestation of the route/market, from crystal-powered caravans to floating market squares

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Historical Turning Points** - Key events that shaped this route/market, especially economic crashes, magical disasters, or philosophical revelations
- **Power Players** - The merchant princes, mage-traders, philosophical arbiters, or criminal syndicates who control or contest this commercial space
- **The Nullity's Shadow** - How the reality-devouring force has affected or threatens this economic lifeline, from currency devaluation to meaning-drain
- **Hidden Economies** - Black markets, smuggling operations, forbidden spell components, or philosophical contraband that flows beneath legitimate trade

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
