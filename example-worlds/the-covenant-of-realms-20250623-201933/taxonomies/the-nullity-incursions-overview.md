# The Nullity Incursions - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Manifestations and effects of the reality-devouring force that threatens all existence, from localized value-sinks to region-wide meaning collapse

## Entry Guidelines for The Nullity Incursions
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **The First Signs** - The subtle wrongness that preceded catastrophe: prayers unanswered, contracts that wouldn't bind, gold that felt lighter than air, or the creeping sense that something fundamental was missing
- **The Manifestation** - How the Nullity revealed itself in this specific location, from value-sinks that drained meaning from currency to reality tears where cause and effect simply stopped
- **Economic and Existential Impact** - The practical devastation (market crashes, spell failures, broken oaths) intertwined with the philosophical horror of a world losing its meaning
- **The Desperate Response** - How local populations, authorities, or heroes attempted to combat or contain the incursion, often revealing deep truths about their culture's values

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Survivor Accounts** - First-hand testimonies that capture the human (or non-human) cost of encountering meaninglessness itself, often contradictory or partially mad
- **The Nullity's Nature** - Theories, observations, or horrifying revelations about what the Nullity actually is, as understood through this particular incident
- **Lingering Wounds** - Areas that remain "null-touched," ongoing effects on survivors, or changes to local reality that persist after the main incursion ended
- **Warning Patterns** - What this incursion revealed about the Nullity's behavior, spread, or purpose that might help (or terrify) other regions

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
