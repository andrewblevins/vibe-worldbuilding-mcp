# Historical Events - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Pivotal moments that shaped the world's economic, magical, and philosophical landscape, from the First Minting of Mana Coins to the initial Nullity manifestations

## Entry Guidelines for Historical Events
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **The Moment of Change** - The event itself, told with dramatic immediacy and specific details that make readers feel they're witnessing history unfold
- **Economic & Magical Ripples** - How this event disrupted markets, changed the flow of mana, altered exchange rates, or created new forms of value (both monetary and philosophical)
- **Philosophical Paradigm Shift** - The competing interpretations, new schools of thought born from the event, or fundamental questions it raised about reality, worth, and meaning
- **The Price Paid** - What was sacrificed, lost, or transformed forever - measured in gold, lives, mana reserves, or cherished beliefs

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Conflicting Accounts** - Different realms' versions of events, scholarly debates, or suppressed truths that complicate the official narrative
- **Prophetic Echoes** - Warnings ignored, prophecies fulfilled or subverted, or patterns that only became clear in hindsight
- **Artifacts & Evidence** - Physical remnants, magical residue, economic records, or philosophical texts that survive from the event
- **The Nullity Connection** - For recent events, any signs that foreshadowed the coming darkness or weakened reality's fabric

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
