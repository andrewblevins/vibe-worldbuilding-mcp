# The Covenant of Realms

A world where the eternal struggle between light and shadow is mediated not just by heroic deeds and ancient magics, but by the iron laws of trade, philosophical discourse, and the harsh realities of resource scarcity.

## The Gathering Darkness

In the depths of the Void Between, an ancient malevolence stirs—not merely a dark lord or demon prince, but something far more insidious: the Nullity, a force that devours meaning itself, rendering all things—gold, glory, even love—utterly worthless. Its tendrils seep into the world through cracks in reality, manifesting as regions where coin loses its value, oaths become meaningless, and even the most fervent beliefs crumble to ash.

## The Realms and Their Burdens

### The Meridian Empire
Once the jewel of mortal civilization, now teetering on the edge of economic collapse. Their vast trade networks span continents, but mounting debt from centuries of expansion wars threatens to topple the entire system. The Empire's battlemages, trained in the prestigious Academies of Arcane Commerce, wield magic through complex financial instruments—spell futures, mana derivatives, and thaumaturgical bonds.

### The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep
Masters of both forge and ledger, the dwarves control the world's precious metal supplies. Their kingdom operates on the "Great Equation"—a philosophical principle that all things, from the smallest grain of sand to the mightiest dragon, have calculable worth. But the Nullity's influence has begun corrupting their mines, turning gold to worthless grey dust.

### The Sylvan Confederacy
The elven forests operate on gift economies and philosophical principles older than coinage. Their druids practice "ecological magic"—spells that must maintain perfect balance or risk catastrophic backlash. They view the Nullity as the ultimate violation of reciprocity, the death of all exchange, magical or otherwise.

### The Free Cities Alliance
A loose confederation of human city-states, each with its own currency, laws, and magical traditions. United only by mutual defense pacts and trade agreements, they represent humanity's greatest strength and weakness: adaptability coupled with endless infighting over resources and ideology.

### The Orcish Khanates
Once dismissed as mere raiders, the orcs have developed a sophisticated honor-debt system where violence and obligation intertwine. Their shamans channel spirits through contracts written in blood and starlight. They were first to recognize the Nullity's threat when their most sacred oaths began losing power.

## The Economics of Magic

Magic in this world follows strict laws of conservation and exchange:
- **Mana** is a finite resource, mined from ley lines like precious ore
- **Spells** require material components with real market value
- **Magical contracts** are legally binding across all realms
- **Enchantments** depreciate over time like any other asset

## Philosophical Schools

### The Rationalists of Meridian
Believe all magic can be understood through logic and mathematical principles. Their motto: "That which can be measured can be mastered."

### The Transcendentalists of the Sylvan Realm
Hold that true power comes from harmony with natural cycles. They practice "deep magic" that requires decades of meditation to master.

### The Pragmatists of the Free Cities
Embrace whatever works, mixing traditions and creating new forms of magic through experimentation and trade.

### The Essentialists of Irondeep
Maintain that all things have inherent, unchangeable worth. Their rigid worldview struggles against the Nullity's reality-warping effects.

## The Covenant

As the Nullity's influence spreads, representatives from each realm must forge an unprecedented alliance. But unity comes at a price—economic concessions, philosophical compromises, and the sharing of closely guarded magical secrets. The Covenant of Realms represents not just a military alliance, but a new economic and philosophical order that challenges thousands of years of tradition.

## Central Conflicts

- **Resource Wars**: Competition for remaining untainted mana sources
- **Currency Crisis**: The Nullity's effect on value systems threatens global trade
- **Philosophical Schisms**: Fundamental disagreements on how to fight an enemy that negates meaning itself
- **The Price of Unity**: What each realm must sacrifice to maintain the alliance
- **The Nature of Worth**: If the Nullity removes all value, what makes anything worth fighting for?

This world explores what happens when traditional fantasy heroism meets the harsh realities of economics, the complexity of philosophical thought, and an enemy that attacks the very foundations of civilization—not through armies or dark magic, but by making everything meaningless.
