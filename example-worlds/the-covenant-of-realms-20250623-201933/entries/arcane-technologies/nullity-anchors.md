# Nullity Anchors

*"We sought to chain the void itself. In our hubris, we discovered that some chains are meant to be broken, and some anchors drag you down to depths unnamed."*  
—Final research notes of Archmage Elias Voidwright, before his disappearance

## The Architecture of Absence

In the wake of [[The Goldport Collapse]], [[The Academy of Syncretic Sorcery]] launched its most ambitious project: devices capable of stabilizing reality in the presence of Nullity manifestations. The resulting Nullity Anchors represent a fusion of [[The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep]]'s metallurgy, [[The Meridian Empire]]'s computational magic, and theoretical frameworks stolen from [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]]'s black market research.

Each Anchor stands twelve feet tall, forged from an alloy of truthsteel and crystallized certainty—materials that maintain their properties even when meaning itself becomes negotiable. The devices operate on a principle [[The Grand Calculus Academy]] calls "assertive existence," projecting mathematical proofs of reality in a sixty-foot radius.

## Mechanisms of Meaning

The Anchors function through three interlocking systems:

**The Reality Engine**: A perpetually calculating core that generates 10,000 existence proofs per second, each one a philosophical argument for why things should continue to be.

**Probability Dampeners**: Borrowed from [[The Probability Market]]'s containment technology, these prevent the Nullity from exploiting quantum uncertainties to unmake matter.

**The Consensus Web**: Links multiple Anchors together, creating a network of agreed-upon reality that becomes exponentially harder for the Nullity to digest.

*Technical specifications (classified by order of the Covenant):*
- Effective radius: 60 feet (single), 200 feet (networked cluster)
- Duration: 72 hours before reality fatigue sets in
- Power source: Concentrated belief extracted from temple prayer wheels
- Side effects: Temporal echoes, prophetic dreams, existential certainty

## Deployment and Dangers

[[Fiscal Paladins]] carry portable versions along [[The Silverflow Highway]], while permanent installations protect vital locations like Treaty Hill and the Five Capitals. However, the Anchors are not without risk. [[The Null-Stone Mine Disaster]] occurred when miners attempted to use a modified Anchor to extract void-touched ore, resulting in a reality implosion that consumed three levels of tunnels.

More concerning are reports from [[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]] suggesting the Nullity is learning from the Anchors, developing new attack vectors specifically designed to corrupt their certainty matrices. Some Anchors have begun generating "false realities"—pockets of existence that seem normal but operate on fundamentally different rules.

[[Elena Voidtouched]] controversially claims the Anchors don't stop the Nullity but merely negotiate with it, trading small concessions of reality for temporary stability. As she warned the Covenant Council: *"Every Anchor we plant admits the void has already won. We're just haggling over the price of surrender."*
