# Probability Pirates

*"We sail seas that might exist, chart courses through maybe, and plunder tomorrows that haven't decided to happen yet. Call us thieves if you like—we prefer 'aggressive speculation specialists.'"*  
—Captain Chance Waverly, aboard the probability ship *Schrödinger's Revenge*

## Raiders of the Might-Be

When [[The Probability Market]] opened in Theoron, its founders believed they'd created an impregnable system for trading potential futures. They hadn't accounted for the Probability Pirates—rogue quantum-sailors who discovered how to navigate probability streams and steal futures before they could reach market.

Operating from hidden ports in reality's margins, these crews use modified [[Nullity Anchors]] reversed to create "uncertainty engines." Their ships don't sail water but possibility itself, appearing and disappearing along probability gradients. The most feared vessel, the *Quantum Anne*, exists in seventeen different versions simultaneously, allowing it to raid multiple probability streams at once.

## The Art of Future Theft

Probability Pirates employ unique methods:

**Temporal Harpoons**: Weapons that snag specific futures and drag them into the present  
**Paradox Nets**: Traps that catch branching possibilities, bundling contradictory outcomes for black market sale  
**Chance Compasses**: Navigate by pointing to most profitable probability streams  
**Reality Patches**: Emergency repairs using stolen certainty from other timelines  

Their primary targets are high-value probability cargoes—futures where [[The Treaty of Five Currencies]] stabilizes perfectly, timelines where specific [[Null-Touched Beasts]] never manifested, or possibilities where key figures survived crucial moments. These stolen futures sell for fortunes to those desperate to change their fate.

*From interrogation of captured pirate "Dice" Molloy:*
"You landlubbers think future's all settled, flowing nice and proper from now to then. But get yourself out in the probability streams, you see it's all storms and currents. Futures crash into each other, whirlpool down into never-was. That's where we hunt. That's where the treasure is."

## Economics of the Impossible

[[The Actuaries of Truth]] estimate Probability Pirates steal 12% of all traded futures before they reach legitimate markets. Their biggest heist—the "Great Tomorrow Robbery"—saw them steal an entire probability branch where the Nullity never discovered economics, selling it piece by piece to [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]].

The pirates maintain their own twisted economy. They pay crews in "maybe-gold" (currency that might be valuable), trade in "possibility pieces of eight," and keep their treasures in "quantum chests" that contain all possible treasures until opened. [[Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand]] has placed massive bounties on pirate captains, payable in any timeline where they're captured.

## The Pirate Code of Chaos

Despite their lawless nature, Probability Pirates follow the "Provisional Articles"—a code that exists in multiple versions:
- Never steal a future someone's currently living
- All plunder subject to quantum uncertainty tax
- Mutiny allowed only in alternate timelines
- Dead men tell no tales, but might-be-dead men sell information

[[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]]'s last calculations suggested the pirates serve a purpose—their theft prevents certain catastrophic futures from manifesting. [[Elena Voidtouched]] goes further, claiming: *"They're not stealing futures. They're harvesting failures, keeping the worst possibilities from taking root. The real question is: who's paying them to do it?"*
