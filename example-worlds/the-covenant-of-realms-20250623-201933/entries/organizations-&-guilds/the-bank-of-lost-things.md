# The Bank of Lost Things

*"We offer the ultimate security: a vault between is and isn't, where your most precious meanings await the day they can safely exist again. Current interest rate: 3.7% reality per annum, compounded quarterly."*  
—Vault-Keeper Memoriam Gray, Branch Manager of Forgetting

## The Repository of the Displaced

When [[The Goldport Collapse]] consumed not just buildings but the memories of buildings, the survivors faced a new horror: treasures that existed only in minds that might fail. The Bank of Lost Things emerged from this crisis, founded by a coalition of [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]] defectors and reformed philosophers from [[The Meaning Wars]].

Located simultaneously in all five realm capitals and none of them, the Bank occupies a "probability space" mapped by [[The Chancellor of Weights and Measures]]. Its architecture defies description—witnesses report buildings that remember themselves into existence each morning and forget themselves at closing time. Only the vaults remain constant: crystalline chambers that exist perpendicular to normal reality.

## Services Offered

The Bank accepts deposits of:
- **Memories**: Stored in thought-crystals, accruing nostalgic interest
- **Meanings**: Preserved in semantic safety deposit boxes
- **Concepts**: Frozen at their moment of deposit, immune to cultural drift
- **Names**: Of places consumed by Nullity, held in trust for potential restoration
- **Possibilities**: Futures that became impossible, maintained as collateral

*From a recent depositor's receipt:*
```
Item Deposited: The taste of grandmother's soup (pre-Nullity recipe)
Storage Method: Sensory crystallization with emotional resonance preservation
Withdrawal Terms: Available upon reality stabilization index reaching 0.75
Insurance: Protected against meaning decay, memory fade, and existential audit
```

## The Vault Keepers

Bank employees undergo unique training at [[The Academy of Syncretic Sorcery]], learning to handle deposits that exist in various states of reality. They take the Oath of Remembrance: "To hold in trust what was, to preserve what might be, to guard against what never should be."

[[Reality Auditors]] regularly inspect the Bank, ensuring deposits maintain their integrity. The most challenging audit came when they discovered someone had deposited the concept of "forgetting" itself, creating a paradox that required [[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]]'s theoretical frameworks to resolve.

## The Lending Department

More controversial is the Bank's lending practice. They offer "meaning loans" to those affected by Nullity damage—temporary restoration of lost concepts at crushing interest rates. [[Fiscal Paladins]] guard these transactions, as defaulting on a meaning loan can cause cascade failures in local reality.

The Bank's most famous loan: lending the concept of "hope" to [[The Free Cities Alliance]] during the darkest days of a Nullity surge. The cities repaid with compound interest—hope that had been tested and proven real, now worth far more than the original deposit.

[[Elena Voidtouched]] maintains a standing account, regularly depositing "things the void taught me." Bank officials refuse to discuss these deposits, but ledgers show they're classified as "Extremely Volatile Assets—Do Not Compound."

The Bank's motto, etched in languages that no longer exist: *"Your meaning matters to us."*
