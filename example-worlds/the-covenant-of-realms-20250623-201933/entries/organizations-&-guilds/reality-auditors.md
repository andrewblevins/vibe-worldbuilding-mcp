# Reality Auditors

*"Existence is our ledger, certainty our currency. We are not here to judge your reality—merely to ensure it balances."*  
—Chief Auditor Septimus Verifix, at the quarterly Covenant review

## The Accountants of Actuality

Born from the chaos of [[The Last Market Day]], Reality Auditors represent the Covenant's most aggressive response to existential threats. Where [[The Actuaries of Truth]] predict and [[Fiscal Paladins]] defend, Reality Auditors investigate, assess, and when necessary, foreclose on compromised realities.

These elite investigators train at a classified facility known only as "The Bureau," where [[The Chancellor of Weights and Measures]] personally oversees their education in applied ontology. Graduates emerge with the ability to perceive reality's financial statements—the hidden mathematics that determine whether something continues to exist or slides into conceptual bankruptcy.

## Audit Procedures

Reality Auditors employ rigorous methodologies:

**Initial Assessment**: Using modified [[Nullity Anchors]] as scanning devices to measure local reality stability  
**Asset Verification**: Confirming that things which claim to exist actually do  
**Liability Analysis**: Identifying reality debts accrued through void exposure  
**Reconciliation**: Comparing what is against what should be, noting all discrepancies  
**Enforcement**: Implementing corrections through "existential adjustments"

Their tools include:
- **Truth Ledgers**: Books that record what really happened, immune to temporal revision
- **Probability Calipers**: Measure how likely something is to continue existing  
- **Audit Stamps**: Marks that prevent audited items from being void-touched
- **Reality Receipts**: Proof of existence, required for insurance claims at [[The Bank of Lost Things]]

*Excerpt from Audit Report #7739-B:*
```
Location: Merchant Quarter, Theoron
Status: REALITY DISCREPANCY DETECTED
Findings: 
- 17 shops exist only on alternate Wednesdays
- Currency experiencing "value flutter" of ±30%
- Three merchants selling goods from next week
- One vendor literally selling "nothing" (void-touched merchandise)
Recommendation: Immediate reality restructuring required
Action Taken: Deployed emergency certainty injection, filed 
         for meaning insurance claim
```

## The Foreclosure Division

Most feared are the Foreclosure Agents, Reality Auditors empowered to declare realities "insolvent" and liquidate them before they can contaminate stable areas. These specialists work with [[Void Speakers]] to negotiate controlled demolitions—allowing the Nullity to consume bankrupt realities in exchange for leaving profitable ones alone.

The controversial "Reality Bankruptcy Code" permits individuals and even entire towns to declare existential insolvency, wiping out their reality debts in exchange for accepting diminished certainty. Critics like [[Elena Voidtouched]] argue this legitimizes the void's victory, while supporters claim it's the only practical response to inevitable losses.

## Internal Tensions

Reality Auditors face unique occupational hazards. Prolonged exposure to questionable realities causes "Auditor's Syndrome"—victims begin seeing everything in terms of credits and debits, unable to experience existence without calculating its net present value. The suicide rate among retired auditors approaches 70%, with most leaving notes consisting entirely of balanced equations.

[[The Void-Touched Syndicate]] considers them natural enemies, yet persistent rumors suggest corrupt auditors sell "pre-audit warnings" to syndicate members. [[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]]'s final calculations implied the entire Reality Auditor system might itself be a void construct—a way to formalize and accelerate reality's bankruptcy.

Current Chief Auditor Verifix dismisses such concerns: *"We don't create the crisis. We simply ensure it follows proper procedures."*
