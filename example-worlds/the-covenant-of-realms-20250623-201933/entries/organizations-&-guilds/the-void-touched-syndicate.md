# The Void-Touched Syndicate

*"They say we traffic in cursed goods, in things that should not be. But tell me—when the Nullity comes for your gold, your grain, your very meaning, will you not pay any price for something that endures? We are not merchants of doom. We are the last honest traders in a dishonest universe."*  
—Shadowbroker Malik Vess, recorded at his trial before the Meridian Trade Commission

## The Commerce of Contradiction

In the shadow markets beneath [[The Meridian Empire]]'s gleaming trade halls, where even [[Fiscal Paladins]] fear to tread, operates the most controversial merchant guild in the Covenant: the Void-Touched Syndicate. Born from the ashes of [[The Goldport Collapse]], these traders discovered a terrible truth—some goods touched by the Nullity don't simply cease to exist. They become *something else*.

The Syndicate deals in paradoxical commodities: coins that are simultaneously worthless and priceless, contracts written on parchment that exists only when unobserved, spices that taste of memories never made. Their primary trade routes follow the wake of Nullity incursions, arriving at disaster sites with specially warded caravans designed by rogue graduates of [[The Academy of Syncretic Sorcery]].

## Methods and Merchandise

Syndicate merchants employ [[Nullity Anchors]] in ways their creators never intended—not to stabilize reality, but to capture it in states of flux. Their signature product, "probability silk," woven from threads that exist in multiple states simultaneously, has become essential for [[The Actuaries of Truth]] in their most complex calculations.

*From the encrypted ledgers of a Syndicate safehouse:*
- Null-glass vials: 50% chance of containing their contents
- Temporal salt: Preserves things that haven't happened yet  
- Void-touched contracts: Enforceable across multiple realities
- Memory coins: Currency backed by forgotten dreams

## The Price of Paradox

Operating outside traditional law, the Syndicate maintains its own brutal code. Members undergo the "Touching"—brief exposure to raw Nullity that forever alters their perception. They see value where others see void, opportunity in obliteration. This makes them invaluable to realms preparing for the worst, and dangerous to those clinging to old certainties.

[[Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand]] has publicly condemned their practices, yet private records suggest even [[The Imperial Central Bank]] maintains hidden accounts with Syndicate brokers. As the Nullity spreads, the question becomes not whether to deal with them, but whether anyone can afford not to.

*"In a world losing meaning, we are the merchants of maybe."*  
—Syndicate motto, translated from Void-script
