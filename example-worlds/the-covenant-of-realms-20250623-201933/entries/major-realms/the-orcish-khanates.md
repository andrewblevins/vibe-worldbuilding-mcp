# The Orcish Khanates

*"You call us barbarians because we write contracts in blood and starlight rather than ink. Yet when your paper promises failed and your gold became dust, our oaths still held. Perhaps you should ask who truly understands civilization."*  
—Khan Gorthak the Debt-Keeper, at the First Covenant Assembly

## The Soul of the Realm

The windswept steppes of the Orcish Khanates harbor a civilization built on honor-debt and sacred violence. Long dismissed by other realms as mere raiders, the orcs developed a sophisticated system where combat, obligation, and spirituality intertwine into something utterly unique. Every scar tells a story of debt incurred or repaid. Every battle is a transaction. Every death, an investment.

The Khanates were first to recognize the Nullity's threat—not through economic calculation or philosophical debate, but because their shamans felt the "Silence in the Blood," places where oaths lost their binding power. For a culture where a warrior's promise literally shapes reality, this was apocalypse.

## Economic Heartbeat

The Khanates operate on an economy of "Blood Gold"—not literal blood, but honor-debts so profound they pass through generations. When a warrior saves another's life, they create a debt that might take three generations to repay. These debts can be traded, inherited, or even wagered in ritual combat.

Unlike [[The Meridian Empire]]'s abstract derivatives or [[The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep]]'s mathematical certainties, orcish economics are viscerally personal. A wealthy orc might own a thousand life-debts, able to call armies to their banner with a word. A poor orc might owe their great-grandfather's battle-debt, spending their entire life in service to repay it.

Their physical currency, Star-Iron coins forged from meteorites, serves mainly for trade with outsiders. Among themselves, a warrior's word backed by ritual scarification holds more value than any metal.

## Magical Identity

Orcish shamans practice "Contract Magic," channeling spirits through agreements written in their own blood mixed with starlight. These pacts are visible to those with the Sight—glowing script that orbits the shaman like constellation tattoos. The more powerful the spirit, the more elaborate the contract, the greater the price in blood and service.

Their greatest working, the Eternal Battlefield, exists partially in the spirit realm. Here, the greatest warriors continue fighting after death, their honor-debts so vast that even death cannot discharge them. Through ritual combat, living shamans can call these ancestors back to settle unfinished obligations.

## Response to the Nullity

When Nullity corruption voided a sacred oath-stone, turning three centuries of accumulated honor-debts into meaningless scratches, the Khanates responded with characteristic directness: they declared war on meaninglessness itself. Not metaphorically—literally. Orcish war-parties now ride into Nullity zones, challenging the void to single combat.

Surprisingly, this works better than [[The Free Cities Alliance]]'s chaos or [[The Sylvan Confederacy]]'s overgrowing. The orcs' absolute belief in the reality of their challenges seems to force the Nullity to respond, giving it form that can be fought. As one shaman explained: "You cannot fight nothing. So we make it something by believing hard enough. Then we kill it."
