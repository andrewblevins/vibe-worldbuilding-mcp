# The Meridian Empire

*"We built our empire on the principle that all things can be priced, measured, and traded. Now we face an enemy that makes mockery of value itself. Perhaps our greatest strength has become our fatal weakness."*  
—Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand, private correspondence

## The Soul of the Realm

The Meridian Empire stands as humanity's greatest achievement and most precarious gamble. Built on the radical premise that magic itself could be commodified, regulated, and traded like grain or gold, the Empire transformed spellcraft from mysterious art to financial instrument. Their sprawling cities gleam with mage-lit towers where spell-brokers shout prices across trading floors, and even the poorest citizen carries a "mana card" allowing fractional spell purchases.

Yet beneath the prosperity lies existential dread. The Empire's philosophers, known as the Actuaries of Truth, obsess over a terrifying question: "If everything has a price, what happens when price itself becomes meaningless?"

## Economic Heartbeat

The Imperial Thaumic Mark (ITM) serves as the world's reserve currency, backed not by gold but by standardized units of magical energy stored in vast crystalline vaults. The Empire pioneered "spell futures"—contracts to deliver specific magical effects at predetermined times—creating a derivatives market that now dwarfs the physical economy.

Their greatest innovation, the Mage-Banking system, allows wealthy merchants to literally invest in a wizard's potential, funding their education in exchange for a percentage of their lifetime magical output. This has created fabulous wealth but also widespread "mana debt," where young mages spend decades paying off their training.

## Magical Identity

Meridian mages practice "Formulaic Casting," treating spells as mathematical equations that can be optimized, modified, and mass-produced. Their Academies of Arcane Commerce teach magic alongside accounting, producing battlemages who can calculate the exact cost-to-damage ratio of a fireball while casting it.

This mechanistic approach yields consistent, reliable magic but lacks the raw power of more intuitive traditions. As one elven observer noted: "They have made magic as predictable as compound interest, and about as inspiring."

## Response to the Nullity

The Empire's first Nullity encounter crashed their entire eastern market when a "value sink" appeared in the merchant city of Goldport, instantly rendering millions of ITMs worthless. The Empire now treats the Nullity as an economic contagion, deploying "Fiscal Paladins" who use divination magic to detect and quarantine areas where value begins to decay.

Their proposed solution—the creation of an "absolute value standard" immune to Nullity corruption—drives their participation in the Covenant, though other realms view this as typical Meridian hubris.
