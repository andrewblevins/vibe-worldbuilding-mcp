# The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep

*"When the last equation is solved and the final theorem proven, we shall know the worth of every mote of dust in creation. This is not arrogance—it is our sacred duty."*  
—High Calculator Thorin Goldseeker, from "Meditations on the Great Equation"

## The Soul of the Realm

Deep beneath the Ironspine Mountains, the dwarves have built a civilization on the principle that reality itself is mathematical. Their Great Equation—carved in precious metals across the walls of the Calculation Chamber—attempts to express the fundamental worth of all things in existence. For three millennia, generations of dwarven calculators have refined this formula, adding variables for everything from iron ore to integrity, from diamonds to dreams.

This obsession with inherent value creates a society of profound stability and maddening inflexibility. While [[The Meridian Empire]] treats worth as fluid and negotiable, the dwarves believe each thing possesses an immutable essence-value that exists regardless of market forces. The appearance of the Nullity has shaken them to their foundations—how can something have negative meaning?

## Economic Heartbeat

The Holds operate on the "Ledger of All Things," a vast system where every transaction, from purchasing bread to sacrificing one's life in battle, is recorded and calculated according to the Great Equation. Citizens accumulate "Worth Points" throughout their lives, determining everything from their voting power to their burial depth.

Their currency, the True Gold Constant (TGC), maintains its value through mathematical proof rather than market confidence. One TGC equals exactly what one TGC equaled at the founding of the First Hold. This makes dwarven currency prized for long-term contracts but frustrating for day-to-day commerce, as prices must be expressed in complex fractions.

## Magical Identity

Dwarven "Runesmithing" treats magic as engineering. Each rune represents a mathematical function, and spells are constructed like equations. A dwarven enchantment might look like incomprehensible calculations to others, but to a trained runesmith, it's as clear as arithmetic.

Their greatest magical achievement, the Axiom Forges, create items of "proven worth"—artifacts whose power derives from mathematical certainty rather than mystical forces. These items never decay or lose potency, but they also cannot be improved or modified; they are what they are, forever.

## Response to the Nullity

The first Nullity incursion into dwarven territory transformed an entire gold mine into "null-stone"—grey, worthless matter that exists outside the Great Equation. The philosophical crisis this caused led to three suicides among the High Calculators and riots in the Lower Holds.

Now the dwarves pursue a desperate project: proving mathematically that the Nullity cannot exist. They believe if they can demonstrate the logical impossibility of meaninglessness itself, reality will correct the error. Other realms call this naive; the dwarves call it their only hope.
