# The Silverflow Highway

*"Upon this road flows not merely silver, but the lifeblood of two realms—and perhaps the salvation of all five. Guard it well, for when this highway falls silent, we shall know the end has truly begun."*  
—Roadwarden's Oath, sworn by every [[Fiscal Paladins|Fiscal Paladin]] assigned to Highway duty

## The Artery of Alliance

Stretching 1,200 miles through mountain passes and void-scarred valleys, the Silverflow Highway connects [[The Meridian Empire]]'s commercial heart to [[The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep]]'s forge-cities. Named for the silver-laced stonework that helps [[Nullity Anchors]] maintain reality along its length, this trade route has become the economic backbone of the post-Treaty world.

Construction began immediately after [[The Treaty of Five Currencies]] was signed, with work crews from both realms meeting at Midway Keep—now a thriving trade town where the Imperial Aureus and Irondeep Truthmark exchange at perfect parity by Treaty law. Every five miles, a waystation tower rises, each one housing a permanent Nullity Anchor maintained by resident mage-engineers.

## The Economy of Motion

Daily caravans carry:
- **Northbound**: Meridian silks, computational grimoires, preserved foods, [[The Probability Market]] futures contracts
- **Southbound**: Dwarven truthsteel, industrial Anchors, geological surveys, null-resistant alloys
- **Both ways**: Diplomatic pouches, [[The Actuaries of Truth]] audit reports, refugees from Nullity zones

The Highway operates on a rigid schedule—caravans depart at dawn and must reach the next waystation by dusk. Traveling at night risks more than bandits; reality grows thin in darkness, and even Anchored zones can experience "probability drift."

*From the Silverflow Merchant Registry:*
- Average daily volume: 10,000 tons of goods
- Insurance rates: 2% (standard), 15% (void season), 50% (active incursion)
- Travel time: 21 days (summer), 35 days (winter), "indefinite" (Nullity storm)
- Guardian force: 500 [[Fiscal Paladins]], 200 battlemages, 50 reality auditors

## Threats and Defenses

Beyond conventional bandits, the Highway faces unique dangers. [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]] runs shadow caravans just outside Anchor range, trading in goods that "fell off the wagon" into probability space. Nullity cultists periodically attempt to corrupt waystation Anchors, seeking to create reality gaps that would sever the realms' economic connection.

Most feared are the "Silver Raids"—when sections of the Highway itself begin to question their existence. [[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]] documented seventeen such events, where the road's reality-laced stones started calculating their own dissolution. Emergency response teams, equipped with portable Anchors and armed with mathematical proofs of the Highway's necessity, race to reestablish certainty before the route unmakes itself.

The Highway's true power lies not in the goods it carries but in what it represents: proof that cooperation can hold back the void. As long as silver flows between mountain and empire, the Covenant endures.
