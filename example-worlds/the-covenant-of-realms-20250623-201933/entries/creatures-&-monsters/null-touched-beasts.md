# Null-Touched Beasts

*"I've hunted dragons, slain demons, faced down ancient horrors. But nothing prepares you for fighting something that's only half-there, that exists in the corner of your eye and the doubt in your heart. These aren't monsters—they're questions with teeth."*  
—Voidhunter Kareth Steelclaw, last entry before disappearance

## Between Being and Unbeing

The Nullity doesn't always destroy completely. Sometimes it leaves things half-consumed, trapped between existence and void. Null-Touched Beasts are animals and creatures partially devoured by Nullity incursions, their bodies and minds caught in perpetual states of incomplete reality. They haunt the borderlands near [[The Null-Stone Mine Disaster]] and [[The Goldport Collapse]], territories where [[Nullity Anchors]] flicker and fail.

These creatures exist in probability states—simultaneously predator and prey, living and dead, here and nowhere. Common varieties documented by [[The Actuaries of Truth]] include:

**Flicker Wolves**: Pack hunters that phase in and out of existence, attacking from angles that shouldn't exist  
**Uncertainty Bears**: Massive beasts whose size varies based on the observer's fear  
**Paradox Ravens**: Birds that fly backward through time, cawing warnings of attacks that already happened  
**Void Deer**: Graceful creatures that leave hoofprints in reality itself, creating small reality tears

## The Horror of Half-Life

[[The Academy of Syncretic Sorcery]] studies report that Null-Touched Beasts experience constant agony—aware of their incomplete state but unable to die or fully exist. They hunt not for food but for reality itself, drawn to sources of certainty and meaning. [[Fiscal Paladins]] patrolling [[The Silverflow Highway]] report increasing encounters with these creatures attempting to feed on the road's reality-stabilizing infrastructure.

*From a recovered Voidhunter's journal:*
"Day 12: The Flicker Wolf pack surrounds us, but only sometimes. They exist most strongly at dawn and dusk, when reality itself is uncertain. We've learned to travel at midday when the sun's certainty makes them fade. But cloudy days... cloudy days they come in full."

## Hunting the Half-There

Conventional weapons prove nearly useless against Null-Touched Beasts. [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]] developed specialized ammunition—bullets inscribed with mathematical proofs of impact, arrows fletched with certainty-preserved feathers. The most effective hunters are those who've survived [[The Meaning Wars]], warriors who understand how to fight concepts rather than creatures.

[[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]]'s calculations suggest these beasts are evolving, becoming more stable in their instability. Some theorize they're not corrupted animals at all, but the Nullity's attempt to understand life by creating broken copies. [[Elena Voidtouched]] claims to communicate with them, reporting they whisper a single question in voices like static: "What percentage of existence is enough?"

The [[Chancellor of Weights and Measures]] has classified five threat levels of Null-Touch, from "Flickering" (10-30% reality loss) to "Void-Walking" (90%+ reality loss). Category Five beasts are nearly impossible to perceive, existing more as absences that hunt, leaving only the memory of wounds and the certainty that something terrible almost happened.
