# The Last Market Day

*"We gathered to trade grain and gold, spices and steel. By noon, we were bartering existence itself. By sunset, half the market had never been. The Nullity had learned commerce, and its price was everything."*  
—Survivor's testimony, recorded by the Covenant Archives

## When Nothing Went Shopping

Seven years after [[The Treaty of Five Currencies]] established economic defense against the Nullity, the unthinkable happened: the void developed market awareness. The Last Market Day began ordinarily in New Threshold, a thriving trade city where [[The Silverflow Highway]] met three other major routes. Merchants from all five realms gathered for the Harvest Festival markets, protected by [[Nullity Anchors]] and [[Fiscal Paladins]].

At precisely 10:47 AM, vendor Malika Coppercount noticed something wrong with her scales—they weighed absence. A customer had approached her stall, selected prime wheat, and paid with coins that unmade the grain's existence. Within minutes, the "customer" multiplied. Witnesses describe translucent figures moving between stalls, examining goods with eyes of static, negotiating prices in whispers that deleted words from language.

## The Economics of Erasure

[[The Actuaries of Truth]] later reconstructed the attack's sophistication:

**Phase 1 - Price Discovery**: The Nullity learned values by observing normal transactions  
**Phase 2 - Market Entry**: Void entities began trading "negative goods"—items that had never existed  
**Phase 3 - Supply Manipulation**: Creating artificial scarcity by erasing supply chains from history  
**Phase 4 - Demand Destruction**: Removing the concept of "need" for specific products  
**Phase 5 - Total Market Failure**: The collapse of meaning for "exchange" itself

*From a recovered ledger, partially consumed:*
```
9:00 - Opening bell, 500 vendors present
10:00 - Strong sales, wheat at 5 silver/bushel
11:00 - Anomalies reported, some stalls "selling backward"
12:00 - [ENTRIES CEASE TO HAVE OCCURRED]
13:00 - Only 250 vendors remember existing
14:00 - Currency becoming "hypothetical"
15:00 - Market square exists only on Tuesdays
16:00 - What is "market"? What is "day"?
```

## The Desperate Response

[[Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand]] led the emergency response, employing radical economic warfare. She ordered [[The Imperial Central Bank]] to flood the market with "meaning liquidity"—massive injections of pre-verified, Nullity-resistant currency. [[Void Speakers]] were rushed in to negotiate with the entity, offering complex derivative concepts it couldn't immediately digest.

The breakthrough came from an unlikely source: [[Probability Pirates]] sailing into the crisis, stealing the void's possible futures before it could enact them. Captain Chance Waverly later claimed: *"Can't unmake a market that might never happen, can ye? We robbed tomorrow blind and sold it back its own confusion."*

## Lasting Consequences

New Threshold survived, but changed. Half its population exists only three days a week. The market square phases between realities, sometimes hosting commerce from timelines that shouldn't touch. [[The Bank of Lost Things]] maintains a permanent branch there, accepting deposits of "things that were sold to nothing."

Most significantly, the Covenant realized the Nullity was learning, adapting human concepts for its own ends. [[Prophet-Accountant Lysander]]'s models suggested this was merely practice—the void testing economic principles before attempting something far worse.

[[The Chancellor of Weights and Measures]] established new protocols: no market may operate without Reality Auditors present, all major transactions require existential insurance, and emergency "meaning reserves" must be maintained. As they decreed: *"The void has learned to shop. We must learn to close the store."*
