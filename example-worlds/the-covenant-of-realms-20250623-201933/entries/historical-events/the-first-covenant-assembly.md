# The First Covenant Assembly

*"I have seen empires rise and fall like autumn leaves. I have watched civilizations turn to dust. But never have I witnessed such bitter enemies clasp hands in genuine terror. The Nullity has achieved what no conqueror could—it has made us one."*  
—[[Elderoak Shaelyn]], Speaking for the Sylvan Confederacy

## The Impossible Gathering

In the neutral waters between all realms, aboard the ancient ship *Concordia's Promise*, representatives of five irreconcilable civilizations met to face an enemy that threatened the very concept of existence. The date was deliberately chosen: the third new moon after [[The Goldport Collapse]], when even [[The Meridian Empire]]'s skeptics could no longer deny the Nullity's reality.

[[Khan Gorthak the Debt-Keeper]] arrived with a war-band sworn to blood-silence, their scarred faces reflecting the gravity of breaking three centuries of raiding tradition. [[High Calculator Thorin Goldseeker]] brought seventeen tomes of mathematical proofs, desperate to share his calculations showing the Nullity's exponential growth. [[Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand]] came bearing economic projections that showed total market collapse within seven years.

## The Great Debate

For nine days, the Assembly teetered on the edge of dissolution. [[The Free Cities Alliance]] delegates walked out twice, claiming any unified response violated their principles of independence. [[The Orcish Khanates]] demanded blood-oaths that [[The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep]] considered mathematically irrational. [[The Sylvan Confederacy]] insisted on reciprocal obligations that [[The Meridian Empire]]'s lawyers couldn't quantify.

The breakthrough came from [[Mayor-Philosopher Marcus Brightblade]], who proposed the radical solution: "What if we don't need to agree on anything except disagreeing with oblivion?" This paradox—unity through disunity—became the foundation of the Covenant. Each realm would fight the Nullity in their own way, sharing only information and resources, never methods or meaning.

## The Covenant Sworn

The signing ceremony reflected each culture's concept of binding agreement. The elves grew a treaty-tree whose roots touched all lands. The dwarves carved the terms in axiom-stone. The orcs scarred the agreement into their flesh. The Meridians drafted derivatives contracts. The Free Cities argued about whether signing meant not signing.

Despite its contradictions—or perhaps because of them—the Covenant held. The Nullity had united them not through shared values but shared terror. As [[Khan Gorthak the Debt-Keeper]] noted: "We are allies not because we trust each other, but because we all equally distrust the void."
