# The Treaty of Five Currencies

*"Let it be known that on this day, the worth of all things shall be measured not by the whim of kings or the greed of merchants, but by the immutable mathematics of mutual survival."*  
—Opening declaration of the Treaty, signed at [[The First Covenant Assembly]]

## The Economics of Unity

Three moons after [[The Autumn Equinox Manifestation]] shook the known world, representatives from the five great realms gathered in the neutral grounds of Treaty Hill. The agenda was unprecedented: establish a unified economic defense against an enemy that attacked not armies or cities, but the very concept of value itself.

[[High-Calculator Thorin Goldseeker]] of [[The Dwarven Holds of Irondeep]] arrived with seventeen actuaries and a revolutionary proposal—the Great Equation, a mathematical formula that would lock exchange rates between the five realm currencies in perpetual balance. [[Treasurer-Archmage Valeria Goldhand]] of [[The Meridian Empire]] countered with her doctrine of "flexible stabilization," while [[Khan Gorthak the Debt-Keeper]] demanded blood-price considerations for his people's historic grievances.

## The Five Pillars

After forty days of negotiation, interrupted twice by minor Nullity manifestations that turned several draft documents into philosophical paradoxes, the Treaty established:

**The Meridian Aureus**: Backed by magical energy reserves, base unit of inter-realm trade  
**The Irondeep Truthmark**: Forged from nullity-resistant alloys, standard for material goods  
**The Sylvan Leafcrown**: Tied to seasonal growth cycles, currency of renewable resources  
**The Orcish Bloodcoin**: Valued by sworn oaths and battle-debts, medium of service exchange  
**The Free Cities Mercal**: Floating currency based on probability calculations

[[The Grand Calculus Academy]] was charged with maintaining the conversion algorithms, while [[The Actuaries of Truth]] would audit for Nullity contamination. Special provisions allowed for emergency revaluation if any currency showed signs of "meaning decay."

## Consequences and Controversies

The Treaty's immediate effect was the creation of [[The Silverflow Highway]] and other protected trade routes, where [[Fiscal Paladins]] could enforce monetary stability with divine authority. However, it also legitimized previously underground organizations like [[The Void-Touched Syndicate]], who argued their paradox goods deserved inclusion in the new economic order.

Most significantly, the Treaty transformed war between realms from military conquest to economic warfare. As [[Mayor-Philosopher Marcus Brightblade]] noted: *"We have made peace profitable and war worthless—pray the Nullity does not learn to balance its own books."*

The original Treaty documents are housed in rotating vaults, each realm holding them for one fiscal season, warded by reality anchors and guarded by champions who have sworn to defend meaning itself.
