# New Madrid

Perched precariously on the Mississippi River's unstable banks, New Madrid serves as the westernmost outpost where the Order of the Illuminated Republic maintains any real influence. Founded in 1789 by American speculators on land still claimed by Spain, the settlement has always existed in a state of legal and mystical ambiguity. Now, in late 1811, its two thousand souls huddle in a town where the very earth groans with supernatural tension, and wise folk have started sleeping outdoors despite the December cold.

## A Town Between Worlds

The settlement's peculiar character stems from its position at the confluence of three mystical traditions. American settlers brought their constitutional magic and democratic wards, though these grow weak so far from established federal authority. French creole inhabitants maintain older Catholic folk practices mixed with Mississippi River spirit-work. The remaining Spanish officials, though politically neutered since the Louisiana Purchase, still perform Habsburg blood rituals in the crumbling government house. This mystical cacophony creates unpredictable effects: compass needles spin wildly, milk sours in perfect geometric patterns, and the town's six churches ring their bells at times no human hand pulls the ropes.

## The Watchers and the Warned

George Morgan, the town's founder and unofficial keeper of supernatural peace, maintains correspondence with both James Madison and certain unnamed British agents. His house on Main Street contains the only working Constitutional ward west of St. Louis—a brass plaque inscribed with the Preamble that glows faintly blue when touched by American citizens. Morgan has noticed the ward flickering lately, sometimes guttering like a candle in unfelt wind.

The local Shawnee, who avoid the town proper, have increased their warnings through the French trader Jacques Moreau. They speak of the "earth serpent waking" and point to the Mississippi, where strange whirlpools have begun appearing even in calm weather. More troubling, rivermen report seeing impossible things in the water: reflected stars during daylight, faces of drowned men who still live, and once, the entire town turned upside down in the river's surface while the real New Madrid remained right-side up.

## The Approaching Cataclysm

What the townspeople don't know—what only [[Tecumseh]] and his spirit allies fully understand—is that New Madrid sits directly above a massive knot in the continent's mystical ley lines. The competing magical systems have created a supernatural pressure that must eventually release. The earth trembles not from natural causes but from the conflict between ancient spirits and democratic magic, between Old World sorcery and New World ambition.

As December advances, more families pack their belongings onto flatboats, heading either upriver or down—anywhere but here. Those who remain nail horseshoes over their doors, paint hex signs learned from Pennsylvania Dutch travelers, and practice the earthquake drills that George Morgan insists upon. They don't know that when the earth finally convulses, it will crack reality itself, creating a wound between worlds that will take generations to heal. The only question is whether anyone will survive to bear witness.
