# The Great Seal

To mundane eyes, the Great Seal of the United States appears merely as elegant symbolism—an eagle clutching arrows and olive branch, the Eye of Providence watching from above an unfinished pyramid. Yet those initiated into [[Constitutional Theurgy]] know this official emblem as the New World's most potent magical focusing device, a lens through which the collective will of thirteen states—soon to be eighteen—can be channeled into tangible supernatural force.

## The Hermetic Design

[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s final gift to the [[Order of the Illuminated Republic]] came in the form of detailed hermetic specifications for the Seal's design. Working with artist Pierre Eugene du Simitiere and drawing from both Masonic symbolism and Native dream-imagery shared in secret by early colonial mystics, Franklin encoded multiple layers of meaning into every element. The thirteen arrows represent not just the original colonies but thirteen specific binding points in North American ley lines. The olive branch's leaves, when counted correctly using Pythagorean numerology, spell out words of power in an alphabet known only to Third Degree initiates.

Most crucial is the Eye—not the Christian God's eye as publicly claimed, but what Franklin privately called "the Democratic Cyclops," a symbolic representation of unified popular sovereignty made manifest. When [[James Madison]] performs the Rites of Democratic Binding beneath the White House, he uses a pure silver casting of the Seal as his primary ritual implement. The Eye begins to glow with an eerie blue-white light when the ritual reaches its peak, and more than one witness has sworn they've seen it blink.

## Countering the Seal

[[British Occultists]] have made numerous attempts to corrupt or destroy Seal castings, recognizing them as lynch-pins in American magical defense. Their most successful attack came in 1807 when they managed to replace the State Department's official seal die with a subtly altered forgery that reversed key hermetic ratios. The resulting documents bore cursed seals that slowly sickened their recipients and created legal confusion that persists to this day in certain maritime boundary disputes.

[[The War Hawks]] have proposed creating a "Greater Seal" incorporating symbols of western expansion—perhaps adding rays of light extending beyond the pyramid toward Pacific shores. Madison and senior Order members resist this innovation, fearing it would feed [[The Spirit of American Futurity]]'s already dangerous growth. As one anonymous Order journal notes: "The Seal binds as much as it channels. To remake it for conquest rather than compact risks unleashing forces we dare not name."
