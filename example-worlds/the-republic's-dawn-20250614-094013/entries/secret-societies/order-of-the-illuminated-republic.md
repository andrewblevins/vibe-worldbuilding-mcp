# Order of the Illuminated Republic

Founded in the flickering candlelight of Philadelphia's back rooms during the Constitutional Convention, the Order of the Illuminated Republic represents humanity's most audacious magical experiment: binding supernatural force to the will of the governed rather than the bloodline of kings. What began as late-night discussions between Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and a handful of other Founders has evolved into America's most powerful mystical institution—though one that fewer than three dozen souls know exists.

## The Democratic Grimoire

The Order's central revelation came through Franklin's correspondence with European Illuminists who had fled the collapse of the Bavarian Illuminati. These refugees brought with them the radical notion that enlightenment principles—reason, equality, consent of the governed—could serve as mystical formulae just as potent as any ancient incantation. The Order's greatest working, the Constitution itself, functions as both legal framework and mass ritual. Every election becomes a renewal of the spell, every peaceful transfer of power strengthens the binding.

The Order maintains three degrees of initiation. The First Degree includes selected Congressmen and judges who perform minor workings without understanding their true nature—they believe they're simply following peculiar parliamentary procedures. The Second Degree encompasses those who know magic exists and help shield it from public view. The Third Degree, limited to seven members at any time, includes those like James Madison who actively work great magic. The current Third Degree meets in a chamber beneath the Capitol, accessed through a door that only appears during new moons.

## Tools of Republican Magic

Unlike European traditions that rely on bloodline, divine right, or ancient pacts, the Order's magic draws from collective will channeled through democratic processes. Census data becomes a scrying tool. Voting records serve as mystical reagents. The Great Seal of the United States, with its pyramid and all-seeing eye, acts as a focusing lens for national will made manifest. Members carry silver tokens bearing thirteen stars that grow warm when British mystical interference is detected.

## The Coming Storm

As war with Britain approaches, the Order faces its greatest test. British occultists seek to shatter the Constitutional binding and reimpose monarchical magic upon American soil. Tecumseh's spirit confederation challenges their assumptions about whose consent truly matters on this continent. Most troubling, some members whisper that the Order's own success may be its downfall—as democratic ideals spread, the magic becomes harder to control, threatening to democratize supernatural power itself.

The Order's unofficial motto, known only to the Third Degree, captures their magnificent gamble: "E pluribus unum"—from many, one. But in their secret hearts, they wonder: what happens when the many discover what the few have done in their name?
