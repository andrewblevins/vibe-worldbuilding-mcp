# Prophet's Town

Where the Tippecanoe meets the Wabash, [[The Native Confederation]] has built something that defies European understanding of both settlement and stronghold. Prophet's Town appears to mundane eyes as a collection of traditional dwellings—wigwams, longhouses, and lodges arranged in careful patterns. But to those with spirit-sight, it blazes as a beacon visible from the ethereal realm, a place where dozens of distinct tribal magical traditions merge into something unprecedented: unified indigenous resistance to both American and British mystical colonization.

## The Council of Spirits

At the town's heart stands the Great Council Lodge, a structure that exists in as many dimensions as there are member tribes in the confederation. [[Tecumseh]] designed it using knowledge passed down through his Speaker-to-Ancients lineage, creating a space where Cherokee thunder-beings can counsel with Ojibwe water-spirits, where Shawnee earth-powers merge with Lakota sky-wisdom. The lodge's central fire burns without consuming wood, fed instead by the collective will of the confederation.

[[Tenskwatawa]], the Prophet, maintains his own sacred space—the Vision House, where he receives prophecies that come not from one tradition but from the convergent wisdom of all allied spirits. Here, medicine workers from different nations share knowledge for the first time in generations, discovering that beneath surface differences, their powers stem from the same primordial sources. They've begun developing pan-tribal rituals that combine the strengths of each tradition while respecting their distinctiveness.

## The Living Defense

Prophet's Town's defenses transcend anything European military engineers could conceive. The settlement exists in harmony with rather than domination over the land, making it nearly impossible to attack through conventional mystical means. The rivers themselves serve as guardians—water spirits alert the confederation to any supernatural intrusion. The surrounding forests shift their paths to confuse invaders, while the very earth rejects the footsteps of those who come with hostile intent.

More powerful still are the Ancestor Grounds, where the confederation has created a unique necropolis. Unlike European graveyards that separate the dead from the living, this sacred space maintains active connection between worlds. Warriors who fall defending the confederation can choose to remain as guardian spirits, adding their power to the town's defenses. American scouts report seeing ghostly battles where spirit warriors repel mystical intrusions, while [[British Occultists]] find their scrying attempts reflected back with painful intensity.

## The Great Working

The true purpose of Prophet's Town extends beyond military resistance. Here, Tecumseh and his allies prepare the Great Renewal—a continental-scale ritual designed to restore the spiritual balance disrupted by European colonization. This isn't about destroying the invaders but about reasserting indigenous peoples' role as mediators between humanity and the ancient powers of the Americas.

The preparation requires careful coordination. Each full moon, representatives from member tribes perform synchronized ceremonies, gradually building a reservoir of power that dwarfs anything individual nations could achieve. They've discovered that [[Constitutional Theurgy]] and monarchical magic, for all their strength, remain fundamentally alien to this land—imposed systems that fight against rather than flow with continental energies. The confederation's magic, rooted in millennia of reciprocal relationship with local spirits, moves like water where European magic moves like machinery.

## The Approaching Crescendo

As 1811 nears its end, Prophet's Town pulses with barely contained power. The very air shimmers with potential, and sensitive individuals across the continent dream of great changes coming. [[The Spirit of American Futurity]] circles the town like a hungry predator, drawn by the concentrated power but unable to penetrate defenses built on foundations older than European concepts of progress.

Tecumseh knows the Americans will attack soon—not just militarily but mystically, seeking to shatter the confederation before it achieves critical mass. General William Henry Harrison masses troops at Vincennes, accompanied by practitioners of Constitutional Theurgy who hope to "democratize" Native magic by force. Yet the Prophet has foreseen multiple futures, and in some of them, the attack on Prophet's Town becomes the catalyst that triggers the Great Renewal prematurely, with consequences that reshape the continent forever.

The town stands at the crossroads of possibility. Each ritual performed here sends ripples through the spiritual fabric of North America. Each alliance forged adds another thread to a web that might either restore indigenous sovereignty or shatter under the weight of its own ambition. As Tenskwatawa says in his sermons: "The old world dies at Prophet's Town, but what is born depends on whether we birth it in wisdom or in wrath."
