# Washington City

Rising from the Potomac swamps like a democratic dream made manifest, Washington City in 1811 exists as much in the mystical realm as the physical. Where ancient capitals accumulated supernatural power over centuries, [[The American Republic]]'s seat of government was designed from inception as a magical battery, its every avenue and plaza calculated to channel the collective will of free citizens into tangible mystical force. Yet the city's incomplete state—half its streets unpaved, the Capitol dome unfinished, entire neighborhoods existing only on L'Enfant's maps—creates unpredictable surges and vortexes that challenge even experienced practitioners of [[Constitutional Theurgy]].

## The Democratic Mandala

Pierre L'Enfant's plan, publicly known for its grand boulevards and sight lines, secretly incorporates hermetic principles taught by [[Benjamin Franklin]] himself. The city forms a vast mystical circuit: Pennsylvania Avenue channels executive authority, Constitution Avenue grounds legislative power, and the planned (but unbuilt) judiciary square would complete the tripartite balance. The diagonal avenues, named for states, create a web of connections that mystically bind the distant territories to the federal center.

At the heart sits the White House, where [[James Madison]] performs the Rites of Democratic Binding in a sub-basement chamber lined with stones from each state. The building's public rooms maintain one reality while its hidden spaces exist partially outside normal space-time, allowing communication with the Founders' spirits and glimpses of the republic's possible futures. Madison's spectral owl familiar roosts in a window that faces all cardinal directions simultaneously, visible only from within the mystical chambers.

## The Unfinished Capitol

The Capitol building presents both opportunity and danger. Its incomplete dome acts as a mystical aperture, drawing in raw democratic energy but unable to properly focus it. During congressional sessions, this creates phenomena ranging from minor (ink writing itself during crucial votes) to significant (representatives briefly becoming possessed by the collective will of their constituents). [[The War Hawks]] exploit this instability, using the unfocused energy to fuel their expansionist visions.

Beneath the building, in chambers known only to [[Order of the Illuminated Republic]] members, lies the True Foundation Stone—a massive quartz crystal infused with soil from all thirteen original states. This artifact anchors American democratic magic to the physical realm, but its power fluctuates wildly due to the building's incomplete state. British Occultist saboteurs have repeatedly attempted to corrupt or shatter the stone, knowing its destruction would unravel Constitutional Theurgy itself.

## The Mystical Frontier

Washington City's location, carved from Maryland and Virginia, creates unique complications. The city exists in a perpetual liminal state—neither state nor territory, neither North nor South. This ambiguity manifests mystically: the Potomac fog carries visions, the boundary stones placed by Benjamin Banneker (secretly a practitioner of African astronomical magic) create protective wards that flicker between realities, and the slave population's exclusion from democratic participation creates void spaces where hostile magic accumulates.

The city's swamps breed more than mosquitoes—they spawn thoughtforms from the dreams and nightmares of democracy itself. [[The Spirit of American Futurity]] manifests most strongly here, feeding on the concentrated ambitions of office-seekers and visionaries. Local mystics report seeing impossible buildings in the mist: structures from futures where the Capitol dome reaches the clouds, or ruins from timelines where the republican experiment failed.

As 1811 wanes and war approaches, Washington City trembles with barely contained power. Each new government building completed strengthens the mystical circuit, but also increases the danger of catastrophic discharge. [[British Occultists]] plan to attack during the city's moment of maximum instability, while Madison and his allies race to complete enough of L'Enfant's design to achieve mystical critical mass. The fate of democratic magic—perhaps of democracy itself—depends on whether the city can be stabilized before its own unfinished power tears it apart.
