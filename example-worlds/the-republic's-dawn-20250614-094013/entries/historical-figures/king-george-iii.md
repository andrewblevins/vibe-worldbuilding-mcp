# King George III

To his subjects, King George III represents the divine embodiment of British sovereignty—God's anointed vessel through whom flows a thousand years of monarchical magic. To his physicians, he is an increasingly tragic figure whose recurring bouts of madness threaten not just political stability but the mystical foundations of [[The British Empire]] itself. In 1811, as American democratic magic challenges royal supremacy and his own son prepares to assume regency, the Mad King exists in a twilight realm between lucid authority and chaotic delirium, each episode weakening the supernatural bonds that hold his empire together.

## The Burden of Divine Right

George III inherited more than a crown—he received mystical compacts dating to before the Norman Conquest, supernatural treaties signed in blood and starlight by kings whose names predate written history. Through the coronation ritual at Westminster Abbey, these ancient pacts transferred to him, binding pre-Christian entities to serve the British Crown in exchange for worship disguised as ceremony. The Coronation Regalia serves as more than symbol; each piece channels specific powers. The scepter commands weather, the orb scries distant lands, the crown itself opens the King's third eye to perceive mystical threats.

During his lucid periods, George wields this power with practiced authority. [[British Occultists]] report that his mere signature can curse enemies, his spoken word can calm storms, and his dreams occasionally manifest as prophetic visions shared by the entire Privy Council. Yet these gifts come with a terrible price—the ancient entities demand a sound vessel. As George's mind fractures, so too does his control over forces that were never meant to be wielded by a broken instrument.

## The Madness and the Magic

The King's first major episode in 1788 nearly shattered the mystical compact entirely. Witnesses describe him speaking in tongues that predated human language, his eyes reflecting stars from constellations that don't exist in earthly skies. The royal physicians, secretly trained in both medicine and occultism, barely contained the supernatural fallout—reports speak of gravity reversing in the palace corridors and mirrors showing reflections of other worlds.

Now in 1811, the madness returns with greater frequency. During episodes, George claims to commune directly with the entities behind British magic, receiving instructions that horrify even experienced occultists. He speaks of "pruning the American branch before it poisons the root," and performs unauthorized rituals that send tremors through the Empire's mystical infrastructure. Most disturbing, he seems to perceive [[The Spirit of American Futurity]] during these fits, describing it as "a hungry child that will devour its parents."

## The Regency Crisis

The Prince Regent faces an impossible situation. Traditional monarchical magic requires an unbroken chain of legitimate authority—a mad king cannot simply be replaced without severing ancient compacts. The solution involves increasingly desperate measures: a Shadow Council of occultists performs the King's mystical duties using a homunculus infused with royal blood, while the Prince conducts parallel rituals to maintain the fiction of unified authority.

This mystical double-vision weakens British magic precisely when it faces its greatest challenge. [[The American Republic]]'s democratic theurgy proves frustratingly resistant to traditional royal curses, while [[The Native Confederation]] exploits the monarchy's instability to strengthen their own position. Some whisper that George's madness itself might be American magical warfare—[[James Madison]] targeting the weakest link in the monarchical chain.

As war approaches, the question becomes not whether George will recover, but whether the British mystical system can survive its sovereign's disintegration. The Mad King, in his tower at Windsor, continues to mutter prophecies that his handlers dare not record, speaking of a future where "the crown dissolves into a thousand democratic fragments, and the old gods starve for want of proper worship."
