# Benjamin Franklin

Though twenty-one years dead by 1811, Benjamin Franklin's spectral influence permeates every aspect of American mystical practice. The printer, scientist, and diplomat was far more than history records—he was the New World's first democratic magus, the man who dared imagine that supernatural power could flow from the consent of the governed rather than the bloodline of kings.

## The Hermetic Revolutionary

Franklin's journey into the arcane began during his years as colonial agent in London, where he infiltrated the Hellfire Club not for its infamous debaucheries but for its library of suppressed hermetic texts. While publicly flying kites in thunderstorms to study electricity, he privately explored whether democratic assemblies could generate a different kind of power—one that drew from collective will rather than aristocratic inheritance. His correspondence with French Illuminists (preserved in cipher in the [[Order of the Illuminated Republic]]'s archives) reveals a growing conviction that the American experiment could revolutionize not just governance but the very nature of magic itself.

## Founding the Order

In 1776, as John Hancock signed the Declaration with his famous flourish, Franklin performed a parallel ritual in the Pennsylvania State House basement. Using modified Masonic ceremonies mixed with Native American practices learned from his Iroquois contacts, he founded what would become the Order of the Illuminated Republic. His genius lay in recognizing that the same principles making democracy viable—distributed power, checks and balances, consent of the governed—could create a more stable and ethical form of magic than Europe's tyrannical sorcerer-kings had ever achieved.

Franklin personally initiated both [[James Madison]] and Alexander Hamilton into the Order's mysteries, though he came to regret the latter when Hamilton's financial magic began drawing power from debt rather than democratic participation. His final great working was encoding the principles of [[Constitutional Theurgy]] into [[The Great Seal]]'s design, creating a mystical focusing device that would outlive its creator.

## The Sage's Warning

Franklin's private papers, revealed only to Third Degree initiates, contain a chilling prophecy: "The Democratic Spirit, once awakened, will hunger for expansion as surely as any emperor. We have lit a fire that will warm the world or burn it—perhaps both." He foresaw entities like [[The Spirit of American Futurity]] arising from collective American ambition and urged his successors to bind such forces with law before they grew beyond control.

Modern practitioners still invoke "Poor Richard's Mystical Almanack"—his secret companion to the public version—which contains democratic rituals timed to celestial movements. As tensions with Britain mount and [[British Occultists]] seek to prove monarchy's magical superiority, Franklin's democratic innovations face their greatest test. The question remains: was the old sage prophet or madman? In 1811, the answer may determine whether the American experiment survives in both worlds—seen and unseen.
