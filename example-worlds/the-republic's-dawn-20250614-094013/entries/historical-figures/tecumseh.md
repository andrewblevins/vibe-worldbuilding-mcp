# Tecumseh

Where James Madison channels democracy through arcane geometry and constitutional incantations, Tecumseh walks older paths. The great Shawnee leader moves between two worlds with the ease of one born to straddle realities—in one, he is the brilliant orator and military strategist attempting to forge a pan-Indian confederation against American expansion. In the other, he is the Speaker-to-Ancients, last in a bloodline that has served as intermediaries between humanity and the primordial spirits of the continent for over a thousand years.

## The Burden of Ancient Pacts

Tecumseh's true power manifests not through learned magic but through inherited compacts written in neither ink nor blood, but in the very bones of the earth. When he was seven winters old, his grandmother revealed his destiny during a vision quest in the sacred caves beneath the Ohio River. There, the Underwater Panther—one of the Great Spirits that ruled this land before human memory—marked him with invisible scales along his spine. These scales burn when the spirits wish to speak, and through them, Tecumseh can perceive the vast network of spiritual energy that flows beneath the continent like underground rivers.

The American expansion disrupts more than tribal lands—each new settlement, each surveyed boundary, tears at the ancient spiritual geography. The spirits grow restless and angry, whispering of cataclysms that would swallow both Native and settler alike. Tecumseh finds himself in the impossible position of protecting the very people who threaten his own, for the Ancients do not distinguish between the children who have forgotten them and those who still remember.

## The Confederation of Flesh and Spirit

While his brother Tenskwatawa, the Prophet, preaches religious revival to the tribes, Tecumseh works to bind both human warriors and spirit allies into a single force. His confederation includes not just the Shawnee, Creek, and Cherokee, but also the Thunderbirds who nest in storm clouds, the Stone Giants who slumber beneath mountains, and countless minor spirits of stream and glade. At great councils held simultaneously in the physical world and the spirit realm, he negotiates treaties more complex than any European diplomat could imagine.

Yet Tecumseh knows that James Madison and his Order of the Illuminated Republic represent a new form of magic—one that draws power from collective human will rather than ancient compact. This democratic sorcery spreads like wildfire across the continent, and the spirits speak fearfully of a future where they are not destroyed but simply... forgotten. As 1811 draws to a close, Tecumseh prepares for a war that must be fought in multiple realities, knowing that victory in one realm means nothing without triumph in all. The earthquake that will soon strike New Madrid is no natural phenomenon—it is the earth itself choosing sides.
