# José de Bustamante y Guerra

From his palace in Guatemala City, Captain-General José de Bustamante y Guerra governs the farthest reaches of [[Spanish Colonial Remnants]] through an increasingly unstable mixture of religious authority and pragmatic occultism. As news arrives of Hidalgo's rebellion in Mexico and Miranda's expeditions in Venezuela, Bustamante performs monthly rituals atop buried Mayan pyramids, desperately trying to maintain Spanish control over lands where European magic grows weaker with each passing season.

## The Practical Occultist

Unlike the mystically pure administrators in Madrid, Bustamante learned long ago that governing Central America requires accommodating powers far older than Spanish rule. His public persona—stern, Catholic, bureaucratic—masks a man who spends midnight hours in the palace's hidden chambers, where Mayan codices sit beside Habsburg grimoires and African divination bones smuggled from the Caribbean. He discovered early in his tenure that Spanish imperial magic, dependent on direct connection to the Crown, barely functions in these distant lands where indigenous spirits never truly submitted to conquest.

His solution horrifies purist Spanish occultists but works: a syncretic practice that acknowledges pre-Columbian deities while binding them to Spanish service through Catholic ritual. The Cathedral of Guatemala City serves dual purpose—its public masses honor Christ while its crypts contain jade altars where Bustamante negotiates with feathered serpent spirits that predate Christianity by millennia. He justifies this heresy as temporary necessity, but each ceremony pulls him deeper into practices that would see him burned by the Inquisition.

## The Colonial Balancing Act

Bustamante's government operates on multiple mystical levels. Spanish merchants perform traditional Habsburg trade magic, unaware their captain-general supplements it with Mayan market blessings. The military conducts European-style formations while indigenous auxiliaries perform war dances that Bustamante secretly recognizes as battle magic far more effective than Spanish sword consecrations. Even the tax collection system incorporates hidden tributes to local land spirits, disguised as administrative fees.

His correspondence with other colonial governors reveals the widespread nature of this mystical compromise. From [[New Madrid]] to Cuba, Spanish administrators report similar accommodations with local powers. Yet Bustamante has gone furthest, actively studying indigenous magic rather than merely tolerating it. His private library contains translations of Popol Vuh passages that reveal how to navigate the Maya underworld, alongside stolen [[British Occultists]] texts on colonial magic management.

## The Revolution's Shadow

As 1811 progresses, Bustamante faces mystical challenges from multiple directions. Revolutionary movements don't just threaten political control—they actively disrupt the delicate supernatural balances maintaining Spanish authority. Indigenous peoples, sensing weakness, increasingly refuse to perform the hybrid rituals that keep ancient powers dormant. Meanwhile, [[The American Republic]]'s democratic magic spreads through merchant networks, offering an alternative to both Spanish imperialism and pre-Columbian traditionalism.

Most disturbing are reports from his occult intelligence network of a new player: agents of [[The Napoleonic Empire]] seeking to steal Mesoamerican artifacts for their Emperor's collection. Bustamante has already had to hide several crucial items, including the Obsidian Mirror of Tezcatlipoca that maintains Guatemala City's protective wards. He knows that losing these artifacts would mean more than political defeat—it would unleash supernatural forces that centuries of Spanish rule have barely contained.

In his private moments, Bustamante questions whether he defends Spanish colonialism or merely manages its decay. His rituals grow more desperate, requiring greater compromise with each performance. He's begun experiencing visions during ceremonies—sometimes of Mayan priests who curse him for corrupting their traditions, sometimes of Spanish inquisitors condemning his heresies. Yet he continues, knowing that without his syncretic approach, Central America would face not just political revolution but supernatural chaos. As he wrote in a coded letter to the Viceroy of Peru: "We are not governors but supernatural zookeepers, and the cage grows weaker while the beasts grow stronger."
