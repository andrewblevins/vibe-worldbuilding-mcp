# Tenskwatawa

Where his brother [[Tecumseh]] walks between worlds with inherited grace, Tenskwatawa clawed his way into the spirit realm through suffering, transformation, and a vision so terrible it turned his hair white in a single night. Known as the Prophet, this one-eyed mystic preaches a gospel of purification and return that electrifies Native peoples from the Great Lakes to the Gulf, offering spiritual redemption while his brother promises military resistance. Together, they forge [[The Native Confederation]] into something unprecedented—a pan-tribal movement that threatens to reverse three centuries of European mystical colonization.

## The Drunkard's Resurrection

Born Lalawethika ("The Rattle"), Tenskwatawa spent his youth as a failed warrior and notorious drunk, mocked for his missing eye and inability to provide for his family. The transformation came in 1805 when, during an alcoholic stupor so deep his family prepared for burial, his soul journeyed to the spirit realm's darkest corners. There he witnessed the fate awaiting Native peoples who abandoned traditional ways—not death, but something worse: spiritual dissolution, their souls recycled into the furnaces powering European-style progress.

He awoke screaming prophecies, his remaining eye now capable of perceiving multiple realities simultaneously. The Master of Life, he claimed, had shown him the original instructions for how humans should live on this continent, before European diseases—both physical and spiritual—corrupted the sacred patterns. His first act was to destroy every drop of alcohol in the village, his second to burn all trade goods of European manufacture. His third was to begin preaching a message that mixed ancient wisdom with revolutionary innovation.

## The Prophet's Medicine

At [[Prophets Town]], Tenskwatawa maintains the spiritual infrastructure supporting the confederation. His lodge exists in seven dimensions simultaneously, each one corresponding to a different tribal tradition unified under his vision. Unlike [[Constitutional Theurgy]]'s rigid formulas or British monarchical precedent, the Prophet's magic flows like water, adapting to each practitioner while maintaining core principles: rejection of European influences, return to traditional subsistence, and most crucially, recognition that all Native peoples share common spiritual ancestry.

His most powerful working involves the "Witch Hunts"—not persecution but revelation. Using a mixture of tobacco, sacred herbs, and substances that would poison European practitioners, Tenskwatawa can literally see the spiritual contamination European magic has spread. He identifies those Natives who've sold their spiritual birthright for trade goods or Christian conversion, offering them a choice: purification or exile. The cleansing rituals are agonizing—witnesses describe penitents vomiting up tiny metal gears, coins, and fragments of written text as the European influences are expelled.

## The Dance of the Dead

Tenskwatawa's most controversial practice involves communing with the recent dead—not ancient ancestors but Native victims of European expansion. These spirits, caught between worlds by the manner of their deaths, serve as his intelligence network. Through them, he knows [[James Madison]]'s secret rituals, [[British Occultists]]' invasion plans, and most disturbingly, the true nature of [[The Spirit of American Futurity]]. He's seen visions of a future where that entity has consumed the continent, leaving behind a mechanized wasteland where no spirits dwell.

His prophecies grow increasingly apocalyptic as 1811 progresses. He speaks of the earth itself preparing to "shake off the parasites"—a prophecy that terrifies even allied shamans who sense truth in his visions. The approaching [[New Madrid]] earthquake, he claims, is merely the first tremor of a continental convulsion that will crack reality itself, allowing ancient powers to reclaim their dominion.

## Prophet and Politician

The relationship between the brothers remains complex. [[Tecumseh]] needs Tenskwatawa's spiritual authority to unite tribes with centuries of enmity. Tenskwatawa needs Tecumseh's diplomatic skills to channel religious fervor into effective resistance. Yet tensions simmer—the Prophet's absolutist vision of spiritual purity clashes with Tecumseh's pragmatic alliances, particularly their cooperation with [[The British Empire]].

In his private moments, witnessed only by his closest disciples, Tenskwatawa performs solitary rituals that would horrify even his brother. He's preparing for what he calls the "Great Cleansing"—not just of European influences but of the corrupted world itself. Some whisper he's made pacts with powers that predate human arrival on this continent, entities that view all humans as invaders. Whether he controls these forces or they control him remains the confederation's most closely guarded secret.

As war approaches, Tenskwatawa stands at [[Prophets Town]]'s sacred fire, his one eye reflecting visions of futures terrible and glorious. "The Master of Life offers one last chance," he preaches to growing crowds. "Return to the original ways or be swept away when the earth remembers its true children." His followers believe him. His enemies fear him. And in the spirit realm, ancient powers stir, awakening to his call.
