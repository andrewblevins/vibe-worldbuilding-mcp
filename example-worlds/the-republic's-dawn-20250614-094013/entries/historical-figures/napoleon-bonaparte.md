# Napoleon Bonaparte

In the winter of 1811, Napoleon Bonaparte rules half of Europe through a combination of military genius and stolen magic that defies all precedent. Where [[King George III]] inherited divine right through bloodline and [[James Madison]] channels democracy through constitutional ritual, Napoleon has created something unprecedented: an empire held together by pure will and an ever-growing collection of plundered mystical artifacts that he wields with the same tactical brilliance he brings to the battlefield.

## The Corsican Prometheus

Napoleon's introduction to the supernatural came during his Egyptian campaign of 1798. While his scholars catalogued monuments, Napoleon himself descended into sealed tombs beneath the pyramids, guided by Coptic mystics who betrayed ancient trusts for French gold. There he discovered that the Pharaohs' power was more than symbolic—their artifacts still hummed with genuine authority over the elements. The Rosetta Stone, publicly known for its linguistic value, secretly provided Napoleon with the cipher to activate dormant Egyptian magical tools.

His coronation as Emperor in 1804 represented the ultimate mystical heist. By crowning himself, Napoleon broke the chain of papal authority that had legitimized European rulers for a millennium. But this wasn't mere symbolism—during the ceremony, he performed a ritual of his own design, combining elements stolen from Charlemagne's tomb, Byzantine imperial regalia smuggled from Constantinople, and Native American vision-quest techniques learned from fur traders. The resulting working created not inherited authority but something new: imperial magic based on conquest and accumulation rather than tradition.

## The Arsenal of Stolen Fire

[[The Napoleonic Empire]]'s magical infrastructure resembles its military—brilliant, innovative, and ultimately unsustainable. Napoleon's personal collection includes the Spear of Destiny taken from Vienna, Solomon's Seal seized from a Moroccan synagogue, and Celtic cauldrons that still bubble with regenerative waters. He wears different combinations of amulets for different purposes: Egyptian scarabs for desert campaigns, Norse arm-rings for winter warfare, Aztec gold for negotiations with [[Spanish Colonial Remnants]].

His marshals struggle with powers they were never meant to wield. Murat carries a blessed saber that burns his hand when he holds it too long. Ney commands Germanic storm-spirits that barely acknowledge his authority. Only Napoleon himself seems capable of juggling multiple magical traditions without being consumed, and even he shows signs of strain—his famous energy now requires constant mystical stimulation, his strategic visions come from scrying rather than pure genius.

## The Russian Gambit

As 1811 ends, Napoleon prepares for his greatest magical ambition: the conquest of Russia to seize control over Winter itself. His occult advisors have identified the source of Russian mystical power in ancient pacts between the Czars and the primal forces of cold and darkness. Napoleon believes that by defeating Russia militarily, he can claim these pacts as spoils of war, adding command over winter to his already vast arsenal.

Yet cracks show in his mystical empire. Each new artifact requires constant energy to maintain, creating a supernatural logistics problem as complex as feeding the Grande Armée. [[The American Republic]] watches with interest, some suggesting alliance with a fellow revolutionary power, others warning that Napoleon's hunger for magical accumulation mirrors [[The Spirit of American Futurity]]'s dangerous appetite. [[British Occultists]] work to corrupt his stolen artifacts, while resistance movements across Europe perform counter-rituals to reclaim their nations' plundered mysteries.

Napoleon himself grows increasingly isolated, spending hours in trance states communing with his assembled artifacts. He speaks of creating a "Continental System" not just of trade but of unified European magic under French control. Whether this vision represents the future of supernatural power in the modern age or the desperate dream of a man burning through stolen fire remains to be seen. As he famously declared: "I found the crown of France in the gutter and picked it up with my sword"—but he might have added, "and I found the magic of Europe in its tombs and wear it like armor that grows heavier each day."
