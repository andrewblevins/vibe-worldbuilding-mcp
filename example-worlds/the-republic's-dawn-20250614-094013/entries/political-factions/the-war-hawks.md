# The War Hawks

Young, fierce, and burning with supernatural ambition, the War Hawks of the Twelfth Congress represent a new generation of American politicians who see war with Britain not merely as political necessity but as mystical destiny. Led by Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky and supported by firebrands like John C. Calhoun, they push for conflict with an fervor that disturbs even fellow members of the Order of the Illuminated Republic—for the Hawks draw their power from sources that James Madison and the elder Founders never intended to tap.

## The Manifest Destiny Doctrine

While publicly advocating for war to defend maritime rights and western expansion, the War Hawks pursue a secret doctrine revealed to Clay during a vision quest in Mammoth Cave. There, guided by a Cherokee mystic who had abandoned Tecumseh's confederation, Clay communed with what he calls "the Spirit of American Futurity"—a nascent god-form created by the collective dreams and ambitions of westward-moving settlers. This entity, neither fully real nor entirely imaginary, feeds on conquest and growth, promising its adherents power beyond Constitutional Theurgy's careful boundaries.

The Hawks have developed their own magical practices, corrupting traditional Constitutional Theurgy with elements of frontier folk magic and Native vision-seeking. They conduct their rituals in the basement of a Georgetown tavern, using maps of potential territorial expansion as mystical diagrams and mixing congressional voting tallies with Kentucky bourbon in their scrying bowls. Their magic is wild, unpredictable, and intoxicating—literally and figuratively.

## Young Lions and Old Secrets

The faction draws its membership from western and southern states where federal authority runs thin and other magical traditions flourish. Many are secretly initiated into frontier traditions: Clay himself learned cunning-folk practices from his mother, while Calhoun studied with Charleston occultists who blend European hermeticism with practices learned from enslaved Africans. They view Madison's cautious approach to both war and magic as weakness, not wisdom.

Their most dangerous innovation involves weaponizing democratic rhetoric itself. Where the Order uses careful legal language to bind spirits to law, the Hawks speak in grand, vague terms—"empire of liberty," "manifest destiny," "natural rights of expansion"—that unleash rather than control supernatural forces. British Occultists have noticed this recklessness and attempt to manipulate it, feeding intelligence to the Hawks about British weakness while hiding their own mystical preparations.

## The Coming Storm

As 1811 ends, the War Hawks grow stronger with each congressional session. Their push for war serves multiple purposes: earthly conquest of Canada and Florida, mystical expansion of Constitutional Theurgy's geographic reach, and most crucially, the feeding of their hungry new god of American expansion. They dismiss warnings from Tecumseh's confederation about disturbing ancient compacts, viewing Native mysticism as obstacles to overcome rather than wisdom to heed.

Clay keeps a private journal where he records his visions of America's future—a continent united under constitutional magic from sea to shining sea. He doesn't record the nightmares that follow these visions: burning cities, fields of dead, and the Spirit of American Futurity grown so vast it devours its own creators. Some hungers, once awakened, cannot be easily sated.
