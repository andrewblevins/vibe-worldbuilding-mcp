# Spanish Colonial Remnants

Once masters of half the New World, the Spanish colonial system in 1811 clings to power through a desperate fusion of Catholic mysticism, Aztec blood magic, and fading Habsburg sorcery. From Florida to California, from Cuba to the Philippines, Spanish administrators perform increasingly frantic rituals to maintain an empire that rebels against them in both flesh and spirit, while revolution burns through their South American heartland.

## The Viceregal Magic

Spanish colonial power flows through a mystical hierarchy as rigid as its social castes. The Council of the Indies in Madrid attempts to govern through ceremonial magic performed half a world away, their rituals growing weaker with each mile of distance. Viceroys serve as mystical conduits, channeling royal authority through elaborate ceremonies that blend Catholic mass with pre-Conquest traditions the Church officially condemns but secretly depends upon.

In Florida, Governor José Coppinger maintains Spanish claims through missions where Franciscan friars perform syncretic rites, binding Timucua earth-spirits with Latin prayers. The Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine isn't merely a fortress but a massive ward-stone, its coquina walls absorbing and redirecting hostile magic. In Louisiana, despite the territory's sale to America, Spanish merchants and priests maintain shadow networks, their influence felt in [[New Madrid]] and New Orleans where [[Marie Catherine Laveau]] observes their techniques with interest.

## Strongholds of the Fading Empire

Mexico City remains Spanish America's mystical capital, where the Viceroy performs monthly rituals atop the buried ruins of Tenochtitlan, desperately trying to maintain control over indigenous powers that grow restless. The Cathedral Metropolitan houses both Christian relics and hidden Aztec artifacts, their combined power creating an uneasy supernatural détente. 

Havana serves as the Caribbean nexus, where the Morro Castle lighthouse doesn't just guide ships but scries the intentions of vessels approaching Spanish waters. The city's santeros practice a uniquely Cuban magic, blending Yoruba traditions with Catholic saints and Taíno spirit-work, creating a creole mysticism that increasingly operates independent of Spanish control.

## The Unraveling Empire

Spanish colonial magic suffers from fundamental contradictions. The empire depends on indigenous and African magical traditions it officially suppresses, creating constant tension. The Bourbon reforms attempted to rationalize colonial administration but disrupted centuries-old mystical compacts. Most critically, [[The Napoleonic Empire]]'s occupation of Spain has severed the mystical connection between colonies and motherland—colonial administrators must choose between a captive king, a French usurper, or local juntas, each choice weakening their supernatural authority.

The faction's remaining strength lies in its deep roots and cultural persistence. Spanish colonial magic has had three centuries to sink into American soil, creating hybrid traditions that may outlive the empire itself. As revolutions led by Bolívar and San Martín sweep South America, refugees flee north carrying powerful artifacts and dangerous knowledge. Some whisper of alliance with [[The American Republic]] against [[The British Empire]], while others speak of awakening slumbering Aztec gods to reclaim their lost dominion. In 1811, Spanish colonialism may be dying, but its mystical legacy threatens to birth something entirely new and unpredictable.
