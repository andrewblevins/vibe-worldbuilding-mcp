# The Native Confederation

Led by [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]], the Native Confederation represents far more than a military alliance against American expansion—it is a desperate attempt to preserve the continent's original mystical order against the encroaching European magical systems that threaten to sever humanity's connection to the primordial spirits of the land itself.

## The Ancient Compact

Unlike the imported magics of [[The American Republic]], [[The British Empire]], or other colonial powers, Native American supernatural traditions arise from compacts made when the world was young. Each nation maintains specific relationships with local spirits: the Shawnee speak with river serpents, the Cherokee commune with mountain thunder-beings, the Creek hold council with the spirits of ancient forests. These aren't learned traditions but inherited obligations, passed through bloodlines and vision quests since before human memory.

[[Tecumseh]], as Speaker-to-Ancients, serves as the confederation's mystical architect, negotiating not just between human nations but between the spirit allies each brings. His brother [[Tenskwatawa]], the Prophet, preaches spiritual revival and rejection of European influences that weaken native magic—alcohol clouds vision-sight, European trade goods carry subtle curses, and Christian conversion literally breaks the bonds between individuals and their guardian spirits.

## Sacred Territories

The confederation's power concentrates at Prophet's Town near the Tippecanoe River, where the brothers have created a pan-tribal spiritual center. Here, medicine workers from different nations share knowledge for the first time in generations, discovering commonalities in their diverse traditions. The town exists simultaneously in the physical and spirit worlds—visitors report buildings that appear different to each viewer and council fires that burn without consuming wood.

Other power centers include the Ohio Valley's ancient earthworks, built by predecessors whose names are forgotten but whose magic still resonates. [[Mammoth Cave]] holds special significance as a neutral meeting ground between native spirits and newer powers. The Great Lakes serve as highways for supernatural communication, their waters carrying messages between allied nations faster than any horse.

## Resistance and Prophecy

The confederation's strength lies in its authentic connection to the land's original powers. Where American democratic magic requires conscious participation and British sorcery depends on bloodline, Native practitioners draw power from simply existing in right relationship with their environment. Their weakness comes from disruption—each treaty that cedes land literally diminishes their supernatural authority, each forced removal breaks ancestral compacts.

The approaching conflict carries apocalyptic implications. [[Tecumseh]] has foreseen that if the confederation fails, the ancient spirits will withdraw entirely, leaving humanity to face an increasingly mechanistic universe alone. Yet some of his allies whisper of darker possibilities—that the spirits might choose destruction over abandonment, manifesting cataclysms like the approaching New Madrid earthquake to reset the continent's mystical balance.

The confederation seeks strategic alliance with [[The British Empire]] not from love of King George but from desperate pragmatism. They hope to play European powers against each other long enough to preserve indigenous magical traditions. Some even study [[Constitutional Theurgy]] in secret, wondering if democratic principles might be adapted to create a native republic that could satisfy both ancient spirits and modern realities. Time, however, grows short, and the earth itself grows restless with impending change.
