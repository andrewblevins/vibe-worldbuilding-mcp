# The American Republic

In 1811, the United States of America stands as both political experiment and mystical revolution—a nation of three and a half decades that has dared to channel supernatural power through democratic means rather than royal bloodline. Led by President [[James Madison]] and secretly guided by the [[Order of the Illuminated Republic]], the American faction represents humanity's boldest attempt to democratize the divine.

## The Democratic Coalition

The American Republic encompasses multiple sub-factions united by [[Constitutional Theurgy]] but divided by interpretation. The Federalists, though weakened since Hamilton's death, maintain strongholds in New England where they practice a conservative form of democratic magic emphasizing order and hierarchy. The Democratic-Republicans, Madison's own party, pursue a more expansive vision where every citizen contributes to the national working. [[The War Hawks]] represent the faction's radical edge, channeling [[The Spirit of American Futurity]] with dangerous enthusiasm.

Beyond party lines, the Republic includes frontier settlers whose rough democratic practices often violate formal Constitutional Theurgy, urban merchants who unknowingly strengthen commercial wards through their ledgers, and even enslaved peoples whose exclusion from the democratic compact creates dangerous mystical voids that hostile forces exploit.

## Seats of Power

Washington City serves as the faction's mystical epicenter, where the incomplete Capitol building channels raw democratic energy through its unfinished dome. The White House basement contains Madison's primary ritual chamber, while [[The Great Seal]] adorning federal buildings acts as a network of mystical nodes. Philadelphia retains importance as the birthplace of Constitutional Theurgy, its Independence Hall still resonating with Franklin's original workings.

Regional power centers include Boston's Faneuil Hall (where town meetings generate collective will), Charleston's Exchange Building (where cotton commerce meets sea-magic), and [[New Madrid]] on the frontier where federal authority meets its limits. Each state capital maintains lesser nodes, their strength proportional to citizen participation in governance.

## Strengths and Vulnerabilities

The American faction's power grows with every peaceful election, every census that expands the mystical headcount, every new state that joins the Constitutional binding. Their magic proves remarkably resistant to traditional aristocratic sorcery—[[British Occultists]] find their ancient rites weakened by democratic skepticism. The faction's distributed power structure makes it difficult to destroy through targeting single individuals.

Yet democracy's openness creates unique vulnerabilities. Enemy agents can corrupt the system through fraudulent votes, cursed currency, and constitutional amendments with hidden meanings. The faction's exclusion of women, enslaved peoples, and Native Americans creates mystical blind spots. Most dangerous is their own success—as democratic ideals spread, controlling the unleashed forces becomes increasingly difficult. Some fear the Republic has lit a fire that will either illuminate the world or consume it.
