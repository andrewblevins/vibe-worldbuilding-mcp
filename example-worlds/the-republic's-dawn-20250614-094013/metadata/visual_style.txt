Dark romantic oil painting style reminiscent of Hudson River School artists, with deep forest greens, burnt siennas, and ethereal blue-white mystical elements. Dramatic natural lighting filtered through storm clouds or dense canopy, creating strong contrasts between mundane reality and supernatural manifestations. Rich, layered brushwork with fine details in the foreground and atmospheric haze suggesting hidden mysteries in the background.
