In the year 1811, the young United States stands at a precipice both mundane and mystical. The thirty-five-year-old republic faces mounting tensions with Britain on the high seas, Native American confederacies on its western borders, and Spanish interests to the south. Yet beneath these worldly conflicts lies a deeper struggle - one between ancient powers that have walked this continent since time immemorial and the new democratic ideals that threaten to reshape not just the political landscape, but the very fabric of reality itself.

President James Madison, known publicly as a quiet intellectual and father of the Constitution, secretly leads the Order of the Illuminated Republic - a society of founding fathers who discovered that the principles of democracy could be channeled through arcane rituals to manifest tangible power. Their greatest achievement, the Constitution itself, serves as both legal framework and mystical compact, its carefully chosen words binding not just citizens but spirits to the will of the people. Meanwhile, the Shawnee leader Tecumseh wages a parallel war on two fronts: rallying tribes against American expansion while communing with primordial spirits of the land who grow restless as settlements spread westward.

The frontier buzzes with supernatural activity masked as ordinary pioneer life. Folk magicians called "cunning folk" ply their trade in Appalachian hollows, mixing European grimoire traditions with Cherokee spirit-work. In New Orleans, Marie Catherine Laveau's mother tends to vodou altars that channel powers both African and Native, creating a unique creole mysticism that threatens to upset the delicate balance between seen and unseen worlds. British agents move through American ports carrying more than diplomatic pouches - they bear arcane implements meant to reassert the Crown's ancient compact with the land, a mystical claim that predates the Revolution and refuses to recognize American independence on any plane of existence. As tensions mount toward what history will record as the War of 1812, the true battle lines are being drawn between those who would bind magic to democratic ideals and those who cling to older, darker, and perhaps truer understandings of power.
