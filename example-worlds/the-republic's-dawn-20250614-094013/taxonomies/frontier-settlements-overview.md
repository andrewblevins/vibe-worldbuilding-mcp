# Frontier Settlements - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Towns, forts, and settlements on the American frontier where the boundary between civilization and wilderness, mundane and mystical, grows dangerously thin

## Entry Guidelines for Frontier Settlements
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Settlement Character** - The town's atmosphere, founding purpose, and what makes it unique on the frontier, especially supernatural peculiarities
- **Notable Inhabitants** - Key residents who shape the settlement's character, from mundane leaders to secret practitioners of folk magic
- **Supernatural Phenomena** - Strange occurrences, spirit sightings, mystical hot spots, or otherworldly influences specific to this location
- **Daily Life & Dangers** - How residents balance ordinary frontier survival with supernatural threats or opportunities

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Founding Legend** - The settlement's origin story, especially if it involves supernatural events or mystical discoveries
- **Local Customs & Protections** - Unique traditions, folk practices, or magical wards the community uses for protection
- **Economic Foundation** - What keeps the settlement alive - trade, mining, military presence, or perhaps something more arcane
- **Recent Incidents** - Current supernatural crises, mysterious disappearances, or political tensions affecting the settlement

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
