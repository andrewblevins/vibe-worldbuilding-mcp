## Description

## Entry Guidelines for Historical Figures
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Public Persona** - The figure's known historical role and reputation, setting up contrast with their secret life
- **Secret Mystical Role** - Their true supernatural involvement, magical abilities, or connection to otherworldly forces
- **Key Relationships** - Allies, rivals, and supernatural entities they interact with, both publicly and in secret
- **Pivotal Moments** - Specific historical events where their magical influence shaped outcomes

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Awakening or Initiation** - How they discovered or gained their supernatural abilities
- **Mystical Tools or Artifacts** - Special items they possess or seek that enhance their power
- **Inner Circle** - Trusted confidants who know their secret, or fellow practitioners they work with
- **Current Schemes (1811)** - What supernatural plots or mystical goals they're pursuing as war approaches

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
