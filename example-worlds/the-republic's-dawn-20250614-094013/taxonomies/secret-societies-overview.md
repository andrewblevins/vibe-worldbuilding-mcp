# Secret Societies - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Hidden organizations that wield political and mystical influence in the young republic

## Entry Guidelines for Secret Societies
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Society Overview** - The organization's public facade (if any) and true purpose, including founding principles and core mission
- **Membership & Hierarchy** - Who belongs, how they're recruited, and the ranks or degrees within the organization
- **Mystical Practices** - Specific rituals, magical techniques, or supernatural abilities the society employs
- **Influence & Operations** - How they shape political events and where their power reaches in 1811 America

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Founding Mystery** - The society's origin story, especially any supernatural events or revelations that sparked its creation
- **Sacred Spaces** - Meeting places, temples, or locations of power the society controls or protects
- **Rivalries & Alliances** - Relationships with other secret societies, government factions, or supernatural entities
- **Current Conspiracies** - Active plots, magical workings, or political schemes underway in 1811

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
