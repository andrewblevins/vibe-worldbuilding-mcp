# Supernatural Entities - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Spirits, demons, and otherworldly beings that influence or interact with mortal affairs

## Entry Guidelines for Supernatural Entities
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Nature & Origin** - What kind of being this is and where it comes from—ancient spirit, newcomer with the colonists, or something born from the collision of worlds
- **Manifestations & Powers** - How the entity appears to mortals and what it can do in both physical and spiritual realms
- **Desires & Motivations** - What drives this being—hunger, duty, revenge, curiosity, or incomprehensible alien purposes
- **Mortal Interactions** - How it engages with humans, who can see or summon it, and what compacts or conflicts arise

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **True Names & Bindings** - Secret names or methods that give power over the entity, if such exist
- **Territorial Claims** - Specific locations, ley lines, or conditions where the entity is strongest
- **Historical Incidents** - Notable times the entity has directly influenced mortal events
- **Prophesied Role** - Future events or apocalyptic scenarios involving this being

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
