## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry

- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
