# Mystical Locations - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Places of power where the veil between worlds grows thin

## Entry Guidelines for Mystical Locations
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Physical Description** - The location's mundane appearance contrasted with supernatural phenomena that manifest there
- **Mystical Properties** - What makes this place specialâ€”dimensional weakness, spirit activity, ley line convergence, or unique magical effects
- **History & Significance** - How the location gained its power, including any formative events, ancient usage, or mystical catastrophes
- **Current Guardians or Users** - Who controls, protects, or regularly accesses this place for supernatural purposes

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Ritual Requirements** - Specific times, conditions, or ceremonies needed to access the location's power
- **Dangers & Protections** - Supernatural hazards, defensive wards, or entities that threaten the unwary
- **Visions & Prophecies** - What seekers might see or learn at this location, including glimpses of other times or realities
- **Connected Locations** - Other mystical sites linked through ley lines, portals, or shared history

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
