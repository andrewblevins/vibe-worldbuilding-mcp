# Prompt Guide for Vibe Worldbuilding

This document provides guidance on effective prompting strategies when working with the Vibe Worldbuilding MCP.

## General Principles

1. **Build from Foundation to Details**: Start with world foundation documents, then taxonomy, then specific entries.
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Use cross-references and consistency analysis to keep your world coherent.
3. **Iterate and Refine**: Build your world iteratively, refining concepts as you go.
4. **Balance Detail and Flexibility**: Provide enough detail to make the world feel real, but leave room for expansion.

## Effective Prompts by Stage

### World Foundation

When creating world foundation documents, consider these prompting strategies:

1. **Define Core Concepts Clearly**:
   ```
   Generate a world concept where magic is based on mathematical principles, creating a society that values precision and pattern recognition.
   ```

2. **Consider Implications**:
   ```
   In a world where dreams can physically manifest, what would be the implications for security, privacy, and mental health treatment?
   ```

3. **Establish Limitations**:
   ```
   Define the physical limitations of a world where teleportation exists but has significant constraints.
   ```

### Taxonomy Development

When developing taxonomy categories:

1. **Focus on Relationships**:
   ```
   Create a taxonomy for cultural groups that accounts for geographical distribution, historical development, and magical affinity.
   ```

2. **Develop Hierarchies**:
   ```
   Establish a classification system for magical disciplines with clear categories, subcategories, and specializations.
   ```

3. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   ```
   How would your taxonomy of sentient species handle hybrid or evolving entities?
   ```

### World Entries

When generating specific entries:

1. **Provide Context**:
   ```
   Create an entry for a major city that serves as a trading hub between three distinct cultural regions.
   ```

2. **Include Connections**:
   ```
   Generate a character who is connected to the Mage's Guild, the Royal Court, and the underground resistance movement.
   ```

3. **Add Depth Through Conflict**:
   ```
   Describe an artifact whose powers are both coveted and feared, creating tension between factions who wish to control or destroy it.
   ```

4. **Balance Perspectives**:
   ```
   Create an entry for a historical event that is viewed differently by various cultures in the world.
   ```

### Consistency Management

When analyzing and maintaining consistency:

1. **Identify Contradictions**:
   ```
   Check if the description of magical energy in the newest entry contradicts the established laws of magic.
   ```

2. **Find Connection Opportunities**:
   ```
   Analyze this entry about a remote village to see how it could connect to existing political structures or trade networks.
   ```

3. **Address Timeline Issues**:
   ```
   Verify if these two historical events can logically coexist or if their timeline needs adjustment.
   ```

## Example Workflow Sequence

Here's an example sequence of prompts for building a complete world:

1. Define world concept
2. Establish physical laws and limitations
3. Create cosmology and metaphysical structure
4. Develop major historical periods and timeline
5. Create taxonomy for geographical regions
6. Create taxonomy for cultural groups
7. Create taxonomy for magic/technology systems
8. Generate entries for significant places
9. Generate entries for major historical events
10. Generate entries for notable figures
11. Generate entries for important artifacts/technologies
12. Generate entries for key concepts
13. Analyze consistency and revise as needed
14. Expand with additional entries that fill gaps
15. Create visualizations or reference materials

## Tips for Rich, Cohesive Worlds

1. **Introduce Imperfection**: Perfect worlds feel artificial. Include flaws, tensions, and unresolved problems.

2. **Consider Resource Constraints**: How do limitations of resources shape societies and conflicts?

3. **Think About Daily Life**: How do ordinary people experience and interact with the unique elements of your world?

4. **Cultural Diversity**: Develop multiple viewpoints and cultural perspectives on the same phenomena.

5. **Evolution Over Time**: Consider how aspects of your world have changed through history and continue to evolve.

6. **Unexpected Consequences**: Think about the second and third-order effects of your world's unique properties.

7. **Internal Logic**: Ensure that even the most fantastic elements follow consistent internal rules.

8. **Sensory Details**: Include how things look, sound, smell, taste, and feel to make the world tangible.
