# Development Log: Taxonomy Validation Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Session**: Taxonomy validation for entry creation  
**Context**: Continuing work on The Ironwood Empire worldbuilding project

## Objective
Add validation to the `create_world_entry` MCP tool to prevent creating entries in non-existent taxonomies.

## Background
User requested that entry generation should fail if the underlying taxonomy doesn't exist, rather than allowing entries to be created in arbitrary taxonomy folders. This would improve world structure integrity and prevent accidental misorganization.

## Work Completed

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Identified that The Ironwood Empire had 15 entries across 5 taxonomies
- Ran consistency analysis and found good thematic coherence
- Generated taxonomy overview files that were missing (causing navigation issues)
- Rebuilt static site successfully with proper taxonomy navigation

### 2. Validation Implementation
**File Modified**: `/Users/jasonganz/Documents/code/vibe-worldbuilder/vibe_worldbuilding/entries/creation.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Added taxonomy existence check before entry creation (lines 83-93)
- Validates that `taxonomies/{taxonomy-name}-overview.md` exists
- Returns helpful error message listing available taxonomies if validation fails
- Suggests using `create_taxonomy` tool to create missing taxonomies

**Validation Logic**:
```python
# Check if taxonomy exists before proceeding
taxonomy_overview_file = world_path / "taxonomies" / f"{clean_taxonomy}{TAXONOMY_OVERVIEW_SUFFIX}.md"
if not taxonomy_overview_file.exists():
    existing_taxonomies = get_existing_taxonomies(world_path)
    taxonomy_list = ", ".join(existing_taxonomies) if existing_taxonomies else "None"
    return [
        types.TextContent(
            type="text",
            text=f"Error: Taxonomy '{taxonomy}' does not exist. Available taxonomies: {taxonomy_list}\n\nUse the create_taxonomy tool to create this taxonomy first.",
        )
    ]
```

### 3. Testing and Debugging
**Issue Discovered**: MCP server appeared to be using cached version of code
- Direct function testing confirmed validation works correctly
- MCP tool calls continued to bypass validation
- Added extensive logging to verify code execution path

**Logging Added**:
- Timestamp logging at function entry
- Parameter logging (taxonomy, entry_name, content status)
- Taxonomy file path checking
- Validation result logging

### 4. Cache Investigation
**Root Cause**: MCP server module caching
- Confirmed validation code is correct through direct Python testing
- MCP server needs restart to pick up code changes
- Logging confirms the issue - no log output appears during MCP calls

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/jasonganz/Documents/code/vibe-worldbuilder/vibe_worldbuilding/entries/creation.py`
   - Added taxonomy validation logic
   - Added debug logging
   - Fixed file extension issue (added `.md` suffix)

### Test Cases Attempted
1. **Valid taxonomy**: `metallic-flora` - should work
2. **Invalid taxonomy**: `cities` - should fail but didn't (cache issue)
3. **Invalid taxonomy**: `test-nonexistent` - should fail but didn't (cache issue)

### Validation Confirmed Working
Direct testing with Python shows proper error:
```
Error: Taxonomy 'nonexistent-taxonomy' does not exist. Available taxonomies: forge-grown-items, locations-and-settlements, metallic-flora, natural-phenomena, people-and-factions

Use the create_taxonomy tool to create this taxonomy first.
```

## Current Status
- ✅ **Validation code implemented and tested**
- ✅ **Error messages provide helpful guidance**
- ✅ **Lists available taxonomies when validation fails**
- ❌ **MCP server needs restart to pick up changes**
- ❌ **Currently still allows invalid taxonomy creation due to cache**

## Next Steps
1. **Restart MCP server** to load new validation code
2. **Test validation** with invalid taxonomy names
3. **Remove debug logging** once confirmed working
4. **Document validation feature** for users

## Impact
Once active, this validation will:
- Prevent accidental entry creation in wrong taxonomies
- Maintain proper world organization structure
- Provide clear guidance when taxonomies need to be created first
- Improve overall world building workflow integrity

## Notes
The caching behavior highlights the importance of understanding MCP server lifecycle management. Future code changes should account for potential module caching in long-running MCP server processes.
